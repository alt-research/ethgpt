# Breaking changes in V3

## [`Limit Order Protocol`](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol/) itself changes
- Now contract is pubshed to npm as `@1inch/limit-order-protocol`


- `Order` struct has changed as following:
    ```diff
    struct Order {
        uint256 salt;
        address makerAsset;
        address takerAsset;
        address maker;
        address receiver;
        address allowedSender;  // equals to Zero address on public orders
        uint256 makingAmount;
        uint256 takingAmount;

    -   // Was in v2
    -   // bytes makerAssetData;
    -   // bytes takerAssetData;
    -   // bytes getMakingAmount; // this.staticcall(abi.encodePacked(bytes, swapTakerAmount)) => (swapMakerAmount)
    -   // bytes getTakingAmount; // this.staticcall(abi.encodePacked(bytes, swapMakerAmount)) => (swapTakerAmount)
    -   // bytes predicate;       // this.staticcall(bytes) => (bool)
    -   // bytes permit;          // On first fill: permit.1.call(abi.encodePacked(permit.selector, permit.2))
    -   // bytes interaction;

    +   // Now in v3
    +   uint256 offsets;
    +   bytes interactions; // concat(makerAssetData, takerAssetData, getMakingAmount, getTakingAmount, predicate, permit, preIntercation, postInteraction)
    }
    ```
    where offset is bytes, where every 32's bytes represents offset of the n'ths interaction.

    Eg: for `[2, 4, 6]` offsets:
    ```ts
    (2n << 32n * 0n) + (4n << 32n * 1n) + (6n << 32n * 2n)
    // 0x000000060000000400000002
    ```

    > See `LimitOrderBuilder.joinStaticCalls()` and `LimitOrderBuilder.packInteractions()` utils for help.


- `Order.interaction` is now `Order.postInteraction`, 
as long as `Order.preInteraction` was added.


- New arguments for `fillOrder` and `fillOrderToWithPermit` methods
    ```diff
    function fillOrderToWithPermit(
        OrderLib.Order calldata order,
        bytes calldata signature,
    +   bytes calldata interaction,
        uint256 makingAmount,
        uint256 takingAmount,
    -   uint256 thresholdAmount,
    +   uint256 skipPermitAndThresholdAmount,
        address target,
        bytes calldata permit
    )
    ```
    - `interaction` is pre-interaction in fact.
    - `skipPermit` is just 255'th byte of `skipPermitAndThresholdAmount`, when rest of bytes is `thresholdAmount`
    > See `fillLimitOrder()`, `fillOrderToWithPermit()` and `packSkipPermitAndThresholdAmount()` utils methods and helpers.


- Methods `eq`, `lt`, `gt`, `nonceEquals` no more have address arguments. Use `arbitraryStaticCall` instead in case if you need read value from different smartcontract.

## `limit-order-protocol-utils` library changes:
- Now contract is pubshed to npm as `@1inch/limit-order-protocol-utils`

### The `LimitOrderProtocolFacade`

- new `chainId` argument of LimitOrderProtocolFacade
    ```diff
    import import { ChainId } from '@1inch/limit-order-protocol-utils/model/limit-order-protocol.model';
    new LimitOrderProtocolFacade(
        public readonly contractAddress: string,
    +   private readonly chainId: ChainId | number,
        public readonly providerConnector: ProviderConnector,
    )
    ```


- `LimitOrderProtocolFacade.fillLimitOrder` and `fillOrderToWithPermit` have more abilities now:
    ```diff
    fillOrderToWithPermit({
        order,
        signature,

    -   makerAmount,
    +   makingAmount,

    -   takerAmount,
    +   takingAmount,

        thresholdAmount,
        targetAddress,
        permit,

    +   interaction = ZX,
    +   skipPermit = false,
    })
    ```
    - `interaction` is pre-interaction in fact.
    - `skipPermit` wether to skip maker's permit evaluation if it was evaluated before.
        Useful if multiple orders was created with same nonce.
        
        Tip: you can just check if allowance exsists and then set it to `true`.


- `simulateCalls(addresses[], calldatas[]): Promise<boolean>` no more avaible.

- `simulate(address, calldata): Promise<{ success, rawResult }>` was introduced insted, so you don't need `catch` block anymore.

### The `LimitOrderBuilder`

- `LimitOrderBuilder.buildLimitOrder` have more abilities now:
    ```diff
    buildLimitOrder({
        makerAssetAddress,
        takerAssetAddress,
        makerAddress,
        receiver = ZERO_ADDRESS,
    -   takerAddress = ZERO_ADDRESS,
    +   allowedSender = ZERO_ADDRESS,

    -   makerAmount,
    +   makingAmount,

    -   takerAmount,
    +   takingAmount,

        predicate = ZX,
        permit = ZX,

    +   getMakingAmount,
    +   getTakingAmount,

    -   interaction = ZX,
    +   postInteraction = ZX,

    +   preInteraction = ZX,
    +   salt = this.generateSalt(),
    }: LimitOrderData)


- `LimitOrderPredicateBuilder.timestampBelowAndNonceEquals` was added to reduce gas.
    ```diff
    -   const predicate = and(
    -       nonceEquals(
    -           walletAddress,
    -           currentNonce,
    -       ),
    -       timestampBelow(timestamp),
    -   );
    
    +   const predicate = timestampBelowAndNonceEquals(
    +       timestamp,
    +       currentNonce,
    +       walletAddress,
    +   );
    ```

### The `LimitOrderPredicateBuilder`

- `LimitOrderPredicateBuilder.arbitraryStaticCall` was added to get values from other smartcontract.

- `LimitOrderPredicateBuilder` members `eq`, `lt`, `gt`, `nonceEquals` no more have address arguments. Use `arbitraryStaticCall` instead in case if you need read value from different smartcontract.
    Eg:
    ```ts
    eq(
        nonce,
        arbitraryStaticCall(SIDE_NONCE_MANAGER_ADDRESS, callData),
    )

### The `SeriesNonceManagerFacade`
- Was added to help you manage different groups of "cancel all" nonces
