## Documentation for the Ethereum Codebase

### Package: eth

The `eth` package contains the implementation of the Ethereum protocol. It provides the core functionality for interacting with the Ethereum network, including managing the blockchain, handling transactions, and communicating with other nodes on the network.

### Type: snapHandler

The `snapHandler` type implements the `snap.Backend` interface to handle the various network packets that are sent as replies or broadcasts. It is a wrapper around the `handler` type, which is the main Ethereum protocol handler.

### Function: (h *snapHandler) Chain() *core.BlockChain

The `Chain` function returns a pointer to the `BlockChain` instance associated with the `snapHandler`.

### Function: (h *snapHandler) RunPeer(peer *snap.Peer, hand snap.Handler) error

The `RunPeer` function is invoked when a peer joins on the `snap` protocol. It takes a `snap.Peer` instance and a `snap.Handler` instance as arguments and returns an error. It calls the `runSnapExtension` function of the underlying `handler` instance to handle the peer.

### Function: (h *snapHandler) PeerInfo(id enode.ID) interface{}

The `PeerInfo` function retrieves all known `snap` information about a peer. It takes an `enode.ID` instance as an argument and returns an interface. It checks if the peer is known and has a `snapExt` instance associated with it, and returns the result of calling the `info` function of the `snapExt` instance.

### Function: (h *snapHandler) Handle(peer *snap.Peer, packet snap.Packet) error

The `Handle` function is invoked from a peer's message handler when it receives a new remote message that the handler couldn't consume and serve itself. It takes a `snap.Peer` instance and a `snap.Packet` instance as arguments and returns an error. It calls the `DeliverSnapPacket` function of the `downloader` instance associated with the `snapHandler` to handle the packet.
