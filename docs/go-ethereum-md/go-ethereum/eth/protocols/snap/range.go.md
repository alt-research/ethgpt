The code you provided is a Go package called `snap`. It contains a type called `hashRange` which is a utility to handle ranges of hashes. The `hashRange` type has three methods: `newHashRange`, `Next`, and `Start`, and two fields: `current` and `step`.

The `newHashRange` function creates a new `hashRange` instance. It takes two arguments: `start` and `num`. `start` is a `common.Hash` and `num` is a `uint64`. It returns a pointer to a new `hashRange` instance. The `start` argument is the starting point of the hash range, and `num` is the number of chunks to divide the hash space into. The function calculates the step size based on the number of chunks and the remaining hash space. It then creates a new `hashRange` instance with the `current` field set to the `start` argument and the `step` field set to the calculated step size.

The `Next` method pushes the hash range to the next interval. It returns a boolean indicating whether the next interval is valid or not. If the next interval is valid, the `current` field is updated to the next interval, and the method returns `true`. If the next interval is not valid, the `current` field is not updated, and the method returns `false`.

The `Start` method returns the first hash in the current interval. It returns a `common.Hash` value.

The `End` method returns the last hash in the current interval. It returns a `common.Hash` value. If the end overflows (non-divisible range), it returns a shorter interval.

The `incHash` function returns the next hash in lexicographical order (a.k.a plus one). It takes a `common.Hash` argument and returns a `common.Hash` value.
