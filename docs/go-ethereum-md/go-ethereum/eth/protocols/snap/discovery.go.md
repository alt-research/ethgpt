Hello! Thank you for sharing this code with me. I'd be happy to help you generate professional documentation for this codebase in Markdown format.

First, let's take a look at the code you provided. This is a Go package that defines an `enrEntry` struct and a method called `ENRKey()`.

The `enrEntry` struct represents an ENR (Ethereum Name Service Record) entry that advertises the `snap` protocol on the discovery. The `Rest` field is a slice of `rlp.RawValue` and is used to ignore any additional fields that may be added in the future for forward compatibility.

The `ENRKey()` method is a receiver function that returns the string "snap". This method is used to implement the `enr.Entry` interface.

Here's an example of how you could document this code in Markdown format:

```
# ENR Entry for the Snap Protocol

This package defines an `enrEntry` struct and a method called `ENRKey()`.

## enrEntry

The `enrEntry` struct represents an ENR (Ethereum Name Service Record) entry that advertises the `snap` protocol on the discovery.

### Fields

- `Rest []rlp.RawValue`: A slice of `rlp.RawValue` used to ignore any additional fields that may be added in the future for forward compatibility.

## ENRKey()

The `ENRKey()` method is a receiver function that returns the string "snap". This method is used to implement the `enr.Entry` interface.
