## Introduction

This document provides documentation for the source code of a requestTracker variable in a Go codebase. The requestTracker variable is a singleton tracker for eth/66 and newer request times. The codebase is written in Go programming language.

## requestTracker Variable

The requestTracker variable is defined as follows:

```go
var requestTracker = tracker.New(ProtocolName, 5*time.Minute)
```

The variable is a singleton tracker that is used to track request times for eth/66 and newer protocols. The tracker is created using the `tracker.New` function which takes two parameters: the protocol name and the duration of the tracking window. In this case, the protocol name is `ProtocolName` and the tracking window is 5 minutes.

The `requestTracker` variable is used throughout the codebase to track request times and ensure that requests are not made too frequently. This helps to prevent spamming the network with requests and ensures that the node is not overloaded with requests.

Overall, the `requestTracker` variable is an important component of the codebase that helps to ensure that the node operates efficiently and effectively.
