## Documentation for Catalyst Package

The Catalyst package is a part of the go-ethereum library and provides functionality for the Ethereum beacon chain engine. It includes a payload queue and a header queue to track the latest constructed payloads and headers respectively.

### Constants

- `maxTrackedPayloads`: The maximum number of prepared payloads the execution engine tracks before evicting old ones.
- `maxTrackedHeaders`: The maximum number of executed payloads the execution engine tracks before evicting old ones.

### Type: payloadQueueItem

The `payloadQueueItem` type represents an id->payload tuple to store until it's retrieved or evicted.

### Type: payloadQueue

The `payloadQueue` type tracks the latest handful of constructed payloads to be retrieved by the beacon chain if block production is requested.

#### Function: newPayloadQueue

The `newPayloadQueue` function creates a pre-initialized queue with a fixed number of slots all containing empty items.

#### Function: put

The `put` function inserts a new payload into the queue at the given id.

#### Function: get

The `get` function retrieves a previously stored payload item or nil if it does not exist.

#### Function: has

The `has` function checks if a particular payload is already tracked.

### Type: headerQueueItem

The `headerQueueItem` type represents a hash->header tuple to store until it's retrieved or evicted.

### Type: headerQueue

The `headerQueue` type tracks the latest handful of constructed headers to be retrieved by the beacon chain if block production is requested.

#### Function: newHeaderQueue

The `newHeaderQueue` function creates a pre-initialized queue with a fixed number of slots all containing empty items.

#### Function: put

The `put` function inserts a new header into the queue at the given hash.

#### Function: get

The `get` function retrieves a previously stored header item or nil if it does not exist.

#### Function: has

The `has` function checks if a particular header is already tracked. ## Documentation for Header Queue Codebase

### Function: newHeaderQueue

The `newHeaderQueue` function initializes a new header queue with a fixed number of slots, all containing empty items. It returns a pointer to the newly created `headerQueue` struct.

```go
func newHeaderQueue() *headerQueue {
	return &headerQueue{
		headers: make([]*headerQueueItem, maxTrackedHeaders),
	}
}
```

### Method: put

The `put` method inserts a new header into the queue at the given hash. It first acquires a write lock on the queue to ensure thread safety. It then copies all existing headers one slot to the right, effectively making room for the new header at the front of the queue. Finally, it creates a new `headerQueueItem` with the provided hash and header data and inserts it at the front of the queue.

```go
func (q *headerQueue) put(hash common.Hash, data *types.Header) {
	q.lock.Lock()
	defer q.lock.Unlock()

	copy(q.headers[1:], q.headers)
	q.headers[0] = &headerQueueItem{
		hash:   hash,
		header: data,
	}
}
```

### Method: get

The `get` method retrieves a previously stored header item or nil if it does not exist. It first acquires a read lock on the queue to ensure thread safety. It then iterates through all existing headers in the queue, returning nil if there are no more items. If it finds a header with the provided hash, it returns the corresponding header data. Otherwise, it continues iterating until it reaches the end of the queue.

```go
func (q *headerQueue) get(hash common.Hash) *types.Header {
	q.lock.RLock()
	defer q.lock.RUnlock()

	for _, item := range q.headers {
		if item == nil {
			return nil // no more items
		}
		if item.hash == hash {
			return item.header
		}
	}
	return nil
}
```

Overall, this codebase provides a simple implementation of a header queue data structure with thread safety. The `put` method allows for easy insertion of new headers at the front of the queue, while the `get` method allows for easy retrieval of previously stored headers by hash.
