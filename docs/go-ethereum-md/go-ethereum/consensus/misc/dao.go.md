Misc Package Documentation

The `misc` package provides miscellaneous functions that are used throughout the Ethereum codebase. It includes functions for validating the extra-data field of a block header to ensure it conforms to DAO hard-fork rules, and for modifying the state database according to the DAO hard-fork rules.

VerifyDAOHeaderExtraData Function

The `VerifyDAOHeaderExtraData` function validates the extra-data field of a block header to ensure it conforms to DAO hard-fork rules. It takes a `ChainConfig` object and a `Header` object as input parameters and returns an error if the validation fails. The function performs the following steps:

- If the node doesn't care about the DAO fork, the function returns `nil`.
- If the block is not within the fork's modified extra-data range, the function returns `nil`.
- Depending on whether the node supports or opposes the fork, the function validates the extra-data contents.
- If the header has the same extra-data as expected, the function returns `nil`.

The function returns an error if the validation fails. The following errors can be returned:

- `ErrBadProDAOExtra`: returned if a header doesn't support the DAO fork on a pro-fork client.
- `ErrBadNoDAOExtra`: returned if a header does support the DAO fork on a no-fork client.

ApplyDAOHardFork Function

The `ApplyDAOHardFork` function modifies the state database according to the DAO hard-fork rules, transferring all balances of a set of DAO accounts to a single refund contract. It takes a `StateDB` object as input parameter and performs the following steps:

- Retrieve the contract to refund balances into.
- Move every DAO account and extra-balance account funds into the refund contract.

The function modifies the state database inline and does not return any value.
