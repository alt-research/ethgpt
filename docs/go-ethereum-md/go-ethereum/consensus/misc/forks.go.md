Misc Package Documentation

The `misc` package provides miscellaneous functions that are not directly related to the Ethereum consensus engine. It includes a function to verify fork hashes.

VerifyForkHashes Function

The `VerifyForkHashes` function verifies that blocks conforming to network hard-forks do have the correct hashes, to avoid clients going off on different chains. This is an optional feature. It takes a `ChainConfig` object and a `Header` object as input, along with a boolean flag indicating whether the header is for an uncle block. It returns an error if the header does not conform to the expected hash for the given hard-fork.

The function first checks if the header is for an uncle block. If it is, it returns `nil` since uncles are not subject to hard-fork hash verification. If the header is for a regular block, it checks if the block is at the specified hard-fork block number. If it is, it checks if the block hash matches the expected hash for the hard-fork. If the hash does not match, it returns an error indicating that the block does not conform to the expected hash for the given hard-fork. If the hash matches or the block is not at the specified hard-fork block number, the function returns `nil`.
