Misc Package Documentation

The `misc` package provides miscellaneous functions and utilities for the go-ethereum library. It includes a function to do a shallow copy of a given chain configuration, and a test function to verify the gas limit checks for blocks across the EIP-1559 boundary and post-1559 blocks.

copyConfig Function

The `copyConfig` function does a shallow copy of a given chain configuration. It returns a new `params.ChainConfig` object with the same values as the original object. It is safe to set new values, but it is not safe to use methods like `SetInt()` on the numbers. This function is intended for testing purposes only.

config Function

The `config` function returns a new `params.ChainConfig` object with the same values as the `params.TestChainConfig` object, except for the `LondonBlock` field, which is set to `5`.

TestBlockGasLimits Function

The `TestBlockGasLimits` function tests the gas limit checks for blocks both across the EIP-1559 boundary and post-1559 blocks. It takes an array of test cases, each containing the previous block's gas limit, block number, new block's gas limit, and a boolean indicating whether the test should pass or fail. It creates two `types.Header` objects, one for the previous block and one for the new block, and calls the `VerifyEip1559Header` function to verify the gas limit checks. If the test should pass, the function expects the `VerifyEip1559Header` function to return `nil`. If the test should fail, the function expects the `VerifyEip1559Header` function to return an error.

The code snippet includes two test functions: `TestVerifyHeader` and `TestCalcBaseFee`.

TestVerifyHeader Function

The `TestVerifyHeader` function tests the `VerifyHeader` method of the consensus engine. It takes a set of test cases as input, each containing a header and a boolean indicating whether the header is expected to be valid or not. For each test case, the function calls the `VerifyHeader` method with the header and checks whether the returned error matches the expected result.

TestCalcBaseFee Function

The `TestCalcBaseFee` function tests the `CalcBaseFee` function, which calculates the base fee of a block according to the EIP-1559 specification. It takes a set of test cases as input, each containing the parent base fee, gas limit, gas used, and the expected base fee of the block. For each test case, the function creates a parent header with the given parameters and calls the `CalcBaseFee` function with the parent header. It then checks whether the returned base fee matches the expected result.

The test cases assume that all blocks are EIP-1559 blocks, and the expected base fee is calculated based on the gas usage relative to the target gas limit. The first test case assumes that the gas usage is equal to the target gas limit, and the expected base fee is equal to the initial base fee defined in the `params` package. The second test case assumes that the gas usage is below the target gas limit, and the expected base fee is calculated based on the formula defined in the EIP-1559 specification. The third test case assumes that the gas usage is above the target gas limit, and the expected base fee is also calculated based on the formula defined in the EIP-1559 specification.

For each test case, the function checks whether the returned base fee matches the expected result. If not, it reports an error with the test case number, the actual base fee, and the expected base fee.
