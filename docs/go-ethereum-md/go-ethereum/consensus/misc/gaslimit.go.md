Misc Package Documentation

The `misc` package provides miscellaneous utility functions for the go-ethereum library. It includes a function for verifying the header gas limit according to the increase/decrease in relation to the parent gas limit.

VerifyGaslimit Function

The `VerifyGaslimit` function verifies the header gas limit according to the increase/decrease in relation to the parent gas limit. It takes two arguments:

- `parentGasLimit uint64`: the gas limit of the parent block.
- `headerGasLimit uint64`: the gas limit of the header being verified.

The function returns an error if the header gas limit is invalid, and `nil` otherwise.

The function first verifies that the gas limit remains within allowed bounds. It calculates the difference between the parent gas limit and the header gas limit, and takes the absolute value of the difference. It then calculates the limit as the parent gas limit divided by `params.GasLimitBoundDivisor`. If the absolute difference is greater than or equal to the limit, the function returns an error with a message indicating the invalid gas limit.

The function also verifies that the header gas limit is not below the minimum gas limit of `params.MinGasLimit`. If the header gas limit is below the minimum gas limit, the function returns an error with a message indicating the invalid gas limit.
