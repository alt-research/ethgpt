Misc Package Documentation

The `misc` package provides miscellaneous functions related to Ethereum consensus. It includes functions for verifying EIP-1559 headers and calculating the basefee of a header.

VerifyEip1559Header Function

The `VerifyEip1559Header` function verifies some header attributes which were changed in EIP-1559. It takes the following parameters:

- `config *params.ChainConfig`: the blockchain's chain configuration.
- `parent *types.Header`: the parent header of the current header.
- `header *types.Header`: the current header to be verified.

The function verifies that the gas limit remains within allowed bounds and that the header is not malformed. It also verifies that the baseFee is correct based on the parent header. If any of these verifications fail, the function returns an error.

CalcBaseFee Function

The `CalcBaseFee` function calculates the basefee of a header. It takes the following parameters:

- `config *params.ChainConfig`: the blockchain's chain configuration.
- `parent *types.Header`: the parent header of the current header.

The function calculates the basefee of the header according to the rules of EIP-1559. If the current block is the first EIP-1559 block, the function returns the InitialBaseFee. If the parent gasUsed is the same as the target, the baseFee remains unchanged. If the parent block used more gas than its target, the baseFee should increase. If the parent block used less gas than its target, the baseFee should decrease. The function returns the calculated basefee as a big.Int.
