Misc Package Documentation

The `misc` package contains miscellaneous functions used throughout the go-ethereum library. It includes two test functions: `TestCalcBlobFee` and `TestFakeExponential`.

TestCalcBlobFee Function

The `TestCalcBlobFee` function tests the `CalcBlobFee` function, which calculates the minimum gas price required for a blob transaction. It takes an excess data gas parameter and returns the calculated blob fee. The function tests the `CalcBlobFee` function with different input parameters and compares the output with the expected output. If the output does not match the expected output, the test fails.

TestFakeExponential Function

The `TestFakeExponential` function tests the `fakeExponential` function, which calculates a fake exponential function using the given factor, numerator, and denominator. It takes these three parameters and returns the calculated fake exponential value. The function tests the `fakeExponential` function with different input parameters and compares the output with the expected output. If the output does not match the expected output, the test fails.
