Misc Package Documentation

The `misc` package provides miscellaneous functions used throughout the go-ethereum library. It includes a function to calculate the blobfee from the header's excess data gas field and a function to approximate factor * e ** (numerator / denominator) using Taylor expansion.

CalcBlobFee Function

The `CalcBlobFee` function calculates the blobfee from the header's excess data gas field. It takes an `excessDataGas` parameter, which is a pointer to a `big.Int` representing the excess data gas. If this block does not yet have EIP-4844 enabled, the function returns the starting fee, which is defined as `params.BlobTxMinDataGasprice`. Otherwise, it returns the result of `fakeExponential` function with `minDataGasPrice`, `excessDataGas`, and `dataGaspriceUpdateFraction` as parameters.

fakeExponential Function

The `fakeExponential` function approximates `factor * e ** (numerator / denominator)` using Taylor expansion. It takes `factor`, `numerator`, and `denominator` as parameters, which are all pointers to `big.Int`. The function returns a pointer to a `big.Int` representing the approximation.

The function initializes `output` and `accum` variables to zero and `factor * denominator`, respectively. It then iteratively adds `accum` to `output` and updates `accum` by multiplying it with `numerator`, dividing it by `denominator`, and dividing it by the current iteration number. The loop continues until `accum` becomes zero. Finally, the function returns `output` divided by `denominator`.
