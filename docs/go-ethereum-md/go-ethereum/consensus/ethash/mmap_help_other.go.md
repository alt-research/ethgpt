Ethash Package Documentation

The `ethash` package provides an implementation of the Ethash proof-of-work algorithm used in Ethereum mining. This package includes functions for generating and verifying Ethash proofs.

ensureSize Function

The `ensureSize` function expands the file to the given size. This is to prevent runtime errors later on if the underlying file expands beyond the disk capacity, even though it ostensibly is already expanded, but due to being sparse does not actually occupy the full declared size on disk. 

On systems which do not support `fallocate`, the function merely truncates the file. More robust alternatives would be to use `posix_fallocate` or explicitly fill the file with zeroes.

This function takes a file object and a size as input parameters. It returns an error if the file cannot be truncated to the given size.
