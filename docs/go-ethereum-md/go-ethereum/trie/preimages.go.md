The code provided is a Go implementation of a preimage store for caching preimages of node keys in a trie data structure. The preimage store is used to cache the preimages of nodes from the secure trie to improve the performance of the trie operations. The implementation uses a memory cache and a persistent database to store the preimages.

The following is a description of each function in the code:

- `newPreimageStore(disk ethdb.KeyValueStore) *preimageStore`: This function initializes a new preimage store with a persistent database.

- `insertPreimage(preimages map[common.Hash][]byte)`: This function writes new trie node pre-images to the memory database if they are not already present in the cache. The function does not make a copy of the slice, so it should only be used if the pre-image will not be changed later on.

- `preimage(hash common.Hash) []byte`: This function retrieves a cached trie node pre-image from memory. If the pre-image cannot be found in the cache, the function queries the persistent database for the content.

- `commit(force bool) error`: This function flushes the cached pre-images into the disk. If the size of the cache is less than or equal to 4MB and `force` is false, the function does nothing. Otherwise, the function writes the pre-images to the persistent database and clears the cache.

- `size() common.StorageSize`: This function returns the current storage size of accumulated pre-images.

The preimage store is used by the trie data structure to cache the pre-images of nodes during trie operations. The pre-images are stored in the cache to avoid the need to read them from the disk repeatedly, which can be slow. The pre-image store is thread-safe and can be used concurrently by multiple goroutines.
