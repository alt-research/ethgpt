The code provided is a Go implementation of a trie data structure. The trie is a tree-like data structure used for efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs. The implementation provides a way to construct an identifier for a trie, which is used to uniquely identify a trie.

The following is a description of each function in the code:

- `StateTrieID(root common.Hash) *ID`: This function constructs an identifier for a state trie with the provided state root. The `ID` struct contains three fields: `StateRoot`, `Owner`, and `Root`. The `StateRoot` field is set to the provided state root, the `Owner` field is set to an empty hash, and the `Root` field is set to the provided state root.

- `StorageTrieID(stateRoot common.Hash, owner common.Hash, root common.Hash) *ID`: This function constructs an identifier for a storage trie which belongs to a certain state and contract specified by the `stateRoot` and `owner` parameters. The `ID` struct contains three fields: `StateRoot`, `Owner`, and `Root`. The `StateRoot` field is set to the provided state root, the `Owner` field is set to the provided owner hash, and the `Root` field is set to the provided root hash.

- `TrieID(root common.Hash) *ID`: This function constructs an identifier for a standard trie (not a second-layer trie) with the provided root. The `ID` struct contains three fields: `StateRoot`, `Owner`, and `Root`. The `StateRoot` field is set to the provided root, the `Owner` field is set to an empty hash, and the `Root` field is set to the provided root.

- `ID`: This struct represents an identifier for a trie. It contains three fields: `StateRoot`, `Owner`, and `Root`. The `StateRoot` field is the root of the corresponding state (block.root), the `Owner` field is the contract address hash which the trie belongs to, and the `Root` field is the root hash of the trie.

- `common.Hash`: This is a type representing a 32-byte hash value. It is used to represent the state root, owner, and root hash in the `ID` struct.

Overall, the code provides a way to construct an identifier for a trie, which can be used to uniquely identify a trie. This is useful in various contexts, such as in tests and in some other tries like CHT trie.
