# Flags

The `flags` package provides a `TestPathExpansion` function that tests the `expandPath` function. The `expandPath` function expands a path string to its absolute form, resolving environment variables and the tilde character.

## Usage

### TestPathExpansion

```go
func TestPathExpansion(t *testing.T)
```

`TestPathExpansion` tests the `expandPath` function. It takes a `*testing.T` as a parameter and returns nothing. It sets up a map of test cases with expected results based on the operating system, and then runs each test case, comparing the expected result with the actual result of calling `expandPath` on the test case. If the expected and actual results do not match, an error is logged.
