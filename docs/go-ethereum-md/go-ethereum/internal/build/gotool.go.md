The `build` package provides a Go toolchain for building and installing Go programs. It includes a `GoToolchain` struct that defines the root directory of the Go toolchain, as well as cross-compilation variables. The `Go` method creates an invocation of the `go` command with the specified command and arguments. It also configures the environment for cross-building if necessary. The `Install` method creates an invocation of the `go install` command, which installs executables to the specified `gobin` directory. The `DownloadGo` function downloads the Go binary distribution and unpacks it into a temporary directory, returning the GOROOT of the unpacked toolchain. This code is responsible for downloading and installing a specific version of the Go programming language if it is not already installed on the system. The function takes a string argument `version` which represents the version of Go to be installed. 

The first step is to check if the current version of Go running on the system matches the requested version. If it does, there is no need to download anything and the function returns the path to the current Go installation.

If the current version of Go does not match the requested version, the function proceeds to download the appropriate installation file from the official Go website. The URL for the download is constructed using the requested version, the operating system, and the architecture of the system.

The downloaded file is saved to the user's cache directory, and then extracted to a directory named `geth-go-version-os-arch` in the cache directory. The function then returns the absolute path to the `go` directory within the extracted archive.

Overall, this code ensures that the required version of Go is installed on the system and provides the path to the installation directory for use in other parts of the program.
