Package version provides functions for retrieving version control system (VCS) information about the current build.

buildInfoVCS retrieves VCS information about the current build from the provided debug.BuildInfo object. It returns a VCSInfo struct containing the commit hash, date, and dirty flag, as well as a boolean indicating whether the information was successfully retrieved.

The VCSInfo struct contains the following fields:
- Commit: the commit hash of the build
- Date: the date of the build in YYYYMMDD format
- Dirty: a boolean indicating whether the build was made with uncommitted changes

The build information is retrieved from the "vcs.revision", "vcs.modified", and "vcs.time" settings in the debug.BuildInfo object. The "vcs.revision" setting contains the commit hash, "vcs.modified" contains a boolean indicating whether there are uncommitted changes, and "vcs.time" contains the time of the commit in a specific format. The function converts the time to the YYYYMMDD format and stores it in the VCSInfo struct.

Note that in Go 1.18 and later, the go tool embeds VCS information into the build, so this function may not be necessary in those versions.
