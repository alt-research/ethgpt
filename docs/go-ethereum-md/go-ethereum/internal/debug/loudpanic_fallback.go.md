The `debug` package provides debugging utilities for the go-ethereum library. It defines a single function, `LoudPanic`.

The `LoudPanic` function panics in a way that gets all goroutine stacks printed on stderr. It takes an interface{} argument and panics with it. This function is only used when the Go version is less than 1.6, and is not used in current versions of the library.
