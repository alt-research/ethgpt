# Go Ethereum Library - Node Package

This package contains the implementation of the Ethereum node. It provides the core functionality for running an Ethereum node, including the ability to connect to the Ethereum network, synchronize with the blockchain, and execute transactions.

## Functions

### TestStartRPC

This function is a test function that checks whether the HTTP server is started correctly. It takes a `testing.T` object, a `*Node` object, and an `*adminAPI` object as parameters. It also takes a `Config` object that specifies the configuration for the node. The function checks whether the HTTP server is reachable, whether the `RegisterHandler` handlers are accessible, and whether JSON-RPC/HTTP and JSON-RPC/WS are accessible. The function returns nothing.

## Imports

### bytes

This package provides functions for manipulating byte slices.

### io

### net/http

This package provides HTTP client and server implementations.

### net/url

This package provides functions for parsing URLs.

### strings

This package provides functions for manipulating strings.

### testing

This package provides support for automated testing.

### github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/rpc

This package provides an implementation of the Ethereum JSON-RPC protocol.

### github.com/stretchr/testify/assert

This source code is used to test the Node API of the Go Ethereum build system. It contains a series of test cases that verify the behavior of the Node API under different configurations and scenarios.

## Functions

### None

This source code does not contain any functions.

## Test Cases

### `TestNodeAPI`

This test case verifies the behavior of the Node API under different configurations and scenarios. It contains several sub-tests that cover different aspects of the Node API.

Each sub-test has a name, a configuration (`cfg`), a function (`fn`) that performs some actions on the Node API, and several expected results (`wantReachable`, `wantHandlers`, `wantRPC`, `wantWS`) that indicate whether the Node API should be reachable, whether it should have registered handlers, whether the RPC API should be enabled, and whether the WebSocket API should be enabled.

The test case creates a new Node instance with the specified configuration, registers a test handler, and starts the Node. Then, it runs the specified function on the Node API and verifies the expected results.

This code block is a function that runs an API call hook. It first checks if the `test.fn` function is not nil, and if it is not, it calls the function with the provided parameters. The function then checks if the HTTP endpoints are available by calling several helper functions. It checks if the HTTP endpoint is reachable, if the handlers are available, if the HTTP RPC is available, and if the WS RPC is available. If any of these checks fail, the function returns an error.

## Functions

### checkReachable

This function checks if the TCP endpoint in the provided URL is open. It takes a `rawurl` parameter, which is the URL to check. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the endpoint is reachable.

### checkBodyOK

This function checks whether the given HTTP URL responds with a 200 OK status code and a body of "OK". It takes a `url` parameter, which is the URL to check. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the URL responds with a 200 OK status code and a body of "OK".

### checkRPC

This function checks whether JSON-RPC works against the given URL. It takes a `url` parameter, which is the URL to check. It returns a boolean value indicating whether JSON-RPC works against the provided URL.

### sp

This function is a helper function that returns a pointer to a string. It takes a `s` parameter, which is the string to create a pointer to. It returns a pointer to the provided string.

### ip

This function is a helper function that returns a pointer to an integer. It takes an `i` parameter, which is the integer to create a pointer to. It returns a pointer to the provided integer.

### not

This function is a helper function that returns a string indicating whether a boolean value is true or false. It takes an `ok` parameter, which is the boolean value to check. If the value is true, it returns an empty string. If the value is false, it returns the string "not ".
