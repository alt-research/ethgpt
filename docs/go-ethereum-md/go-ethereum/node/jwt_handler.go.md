# Go Ethereum Library - Node Package

This package contains a `jwtHandler` struct and related functions that provide JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication support for HTTP requests.

## Functions

### newJWTHandler

```go
func newJWTHandler(secret []byte, next http.Handler) http.Handler
```

`newJWTHandler` creates a new `http.Handler` with JWT authentication support. It takes two parameters: `secret`, which is a byte slice containing the secret key used to sign and verify JWTs, and `next`, which is the next `http.Handler` in the chain. It returns an `http.Handler` that can be used to authenticate incoming HTTP requests using JWTs.

### ServeHTTP

```go
func (handler *jwtHandler) ServeHTTP(out http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)
```

`ServeHTTP` is a method of the `jwtHandler` struct that implements the `http.Handler` interface. It takes two parameters: `out`, which is the `http.ResponseWriter` to write the response to, and `r`, which is the incoming `http.Request` to authenticate. It authenticates the request using JWTs and passes it on to the next `http.Handler` in the chain if the authentication is successful. If the authentication fails, it returns an HTTP error response.

## Structs

### jwtHandler

```go
type jwtHandler struct {
    keyFunc func(token *jwt.Token) (interface{}, error)
    next    http.Handler
}
```

`jwtHandler` is a struct that contains two fields: `keyFunc`, which is a function that takes a JWT token and returns the secret key used to sign and verify the token, and `next`, which is the next `http.Handler` in the chain.

## Constants

### jwtExpiryTimeout

```go
const jwtExpiryTimeout = 60 * time.Second
```

`jwtExpiryTimeout` is a constant that specifies the maximum age of a JWT token in seconds. If a token is older than this value, it will be considered stale and authentication will fail.
