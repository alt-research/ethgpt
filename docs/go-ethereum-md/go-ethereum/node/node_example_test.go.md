# Go Ethereum Library - Node Package

This package contains the implementation of the Ethereum node, which is the core component of the Go Ethereum client. The node is responsible for managing the Ethereum network, executing transactions, and maintaining the blockchain.

## Functions

### None

This package does not contain any functions.

## Structs

### SampleLifecycle

`SampleLifecycle` is a trivial network service that can be attached to a node for life cycle management. It implements the `node.Lifecycle` interface, which requires the implementation of two methods: `Start()` and `Stop()`. The `Start()` method is invoked when the node is ready to start the service, and the `Stop()` method is invoked when the node terminates the service.

## Methods

### Start()

`Start()` is a method of the `SampleLifecycle` struct. It prints a message to the console indicating that the service is starting and returns `nil`.

### Stop()

`Stop()` is a method of the `SampleLifecycle` struct. It prints a message to the console indicating that the service is stopping and returns `nil`.

### ExampleLifecycle()

`ExampleLifecycle()` is an example function that demonstrates how to create a network node, register a simple network lifecycle, and start and stop the protocol stack. It creates a network node with default values, creates and registers a `SampleLifecycle` service, starts the protocol stack, stops the protocol stack, and prints the output to the console.

## Imports

### fmt

This package is used to print messages to the console.

### log

This package is used to log errors to the console.

### github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/node

This package is used to create and manage the Ethereum node. It provides the `node.New()` function to create a new node, the `node.RegisterLifecycle()` method to register a network lifecycle, and the `node.Start()` and `node.Close()` methods to start and stop the protocol stack.
