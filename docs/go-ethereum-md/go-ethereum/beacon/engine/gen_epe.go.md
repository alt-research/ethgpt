This is a Go source code file that contains a package named `engine`. The package provides a `ExecutionPayloadEnvelope` struct that represents an execution payload envelope. The struct has two fields: `ExecutionPayload` and `BlockValue`.

The `ExecutionPayload` field is a pointer to an `ExecutableData` struct that represents the executable data of the payload. The `BlockValue` field is a pointer to a `hexutil.Big` struct that represents the block value of the payload.

The `ExecutionPayloadEnvelope` struct implements the `json.Marshaler` and `json.Unmarshaler` interfaces to marshal and unmarshal the struct to and from JSON.

The `MarshalJSON` method marshals the `ExecutionPayloadEnvelope` struct to JSON. It creates a new `ExecutionPayloadEnvelope` struct with the `ExecutionPayload` and `BlockValue` fields set to the values of the original struct. It then marshals the new struct to JSON.

The `UnmarshalJSON` method unmarshals the `ExecutionPayloadEnvelope` struct from JSON. It creates a new `ExecutionPayloadEnvelope` struct and unmarshals the JSON input into it. It then sets the `ExecutionPayload` and `BlockValue` fields of the original struct to the values of the new struct.

If the `ExecutionPayload` or `BlockValue` fields are missing from the JSON input, the method returns an error.
