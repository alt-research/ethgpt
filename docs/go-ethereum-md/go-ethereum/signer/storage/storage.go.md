Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's the documentation for the code you provided:

## Storage

The `Storage` interface defines the methods that a storage implementation must implement. The `Put` method stores a value by key, the `Get` method retrieves a previously stored value by key, and the `Del` method removes a key-value pair. 

### Parameters

- `key` (string): The key to store or retrieve the value.
- `value` (string): The value to store.

### Returns

- `Put`: None.
- `Get`: The previously stored value or an error if the key is 0-length or unknown.
- `Del`: None.

### Errors

- `ErrZeroKey`: Returned if an attempt was made to insert a 0-length key.
- `ErrNotFound`: Returned if an unknown key is attempted to be retrieved.

## EphemeralStorage

The `EphemeralStorage` struct is an in-memory storage that does not persist values to disk. It implements the `Storage` interface. 

### Methods

- `Put`: Stores a value by key. 0-length keys result in a noop.
- `Get`: Returns the previously stored value, or an error if the key is 0-length or unknown.
- `Del`: Removes a key-value pair. If the key doesn't exist, the method is a noop.

### Parameters

- `key` (string): The key to store or retrieve the value.
- `value` (string): The value to store.

### Returns

- `Put`: None.
- `Get`: The previously stored value or an error if the key is
