This is a Go source code file that implements a fuzzer for the BLS12-381 elliptic curve pairing-based cryptography library. The file contains a set of constants and functions that are used to fuzz different BLS12-381 operations, such as addition, multiplication, and pairing.

The file starts with a header that includes copyright and licensing information. The code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 or later.

The `bls` package imports two other packages: `common` and `vm`. The `common` package provides common Ethereum-related functions and types, while the `vm` package provides the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) implementation.

The file defines a set of constants that represent different BLS12-381 operations, such as `blsG1Add`, `blsG1Mul`, `blsG1MultiExp`, `blsG2Add`, `blsG2Mul`, `blsG2MultiExp`, `blsPairing`, `blsMapG1`, and `blsMapG2`. These constants are used to identify the operation to be fuzzed.

The file also defines a set of functions that implement the fuzzer for each BLS12-381 operation. These functions have the same signature: they take a byte slice as input and return an integer. The input byte slice represents the data to be fuzzed, and the integer return value is used to indicate the result of the fuzzing operation. A return value of 1 indicates that the input should be added to the corpus for subsequent fuzzing, a return value of -1 indicates that the input should not be added to the corpus, and a return value of 0 indicates that the input should be added to the corpus but not prioritized.

The `checkInput` function is used to check the length of the input data for each operation. It returns `true` if the input data has the correct length for the given operation, and `false` otherwise.

The `fuzz` function is the main function that implements the fuzzer. It takes an operation ID and input data as input, and returns an integer as described above. The function first calculates the gas cost of the operation using the `vm.PrecompiledContractsBLS` map, which contains the precompiled BLS12-381 contracts for the EVM. If the input data has an incorrect length, the function returns 0. If the gas cost of the operation is too high (25 million gas), the function also returns 0. Otherwise, the function creates a copy of the input data, runs the precompiled contract with the input data, and checks if the input data was modified during the operation. If the input data was modified, the function panics. If the operation returns an error, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function returns 1.

Overall, this file implements a fuzzer for the BLS12-381 elliptic curve pairing-based cryptography library that can be used to test the correctness and security of the library.
