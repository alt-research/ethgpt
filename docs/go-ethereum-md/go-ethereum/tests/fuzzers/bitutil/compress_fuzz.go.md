## Bitutil Package Documentation

The `bitutil` package provides utility functions for working with bitsets. It includes methods for compressing and decompressing bitsets, as well as encoding and decoding algorithms.

### Fuzz

The `Fuzz` function is a go-fuzz fuzzer method that tests various encoding method invocations. It takes a byte slice as input and returns an integer. If the length of the input slice is zero, it returns zero. If the first byte of the input slice is even, it calls the `fuzzEncode` function with the remaining bytes of the input slice. Otherwise, it calls the `fuzzDecode` function with the remaining bytes of the input slice.

### fuzzEncode

The `fuzzEncode` function is a go-fuzz fuzzer method that tests the bitset encoding and decoding algorithm. It takes a byte slice as input and returns an integer. It first compresses the input slice using the `CompressBytes` function from the `bitutil` package. It then decompresses the compressed slice using the `DecompressBytes` function from the `bitutil` package with the length of the original input slice as the second argument. If the decompressed slice is not equal to the original input slice, it panics. It returns 1.

### fuzzDecode

The `fuzzDecode` function is a go-fuzz fuzzer method that tests the bit decoding and reencoding algorithm. It takes a byte slice as input and returns an integer. It first decompresses the input slice using the `DecompressBytes` function from the `bitutil` package with a buffer size of 1024. If there is an error during decompression, it returns 0. It then compresses the decompressed slice using the `CompressBytes` function from the `bitutil` package. If the length of the compressed slice is greater than the length of the decompressed slice, it panics. It then decompresses the input slice again using the `DecompressBytes` function from the `bitutil` package with a buffer size of 1024. If there is an error during decompression, it panics. If the decompressed slice is not equal to the original decompressed slice, it panics. It returns 1.
