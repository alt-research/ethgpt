## Stacktrie Package Documentation

The `stacktrie` package provides functionality for managing a stack-based trie data structure. It includes methods for inserting, deleting, and querying key-value pairs in the trie.

### fuzzer

The `fuzzer` struct is used to read input data for the fuzzer. It has methods for reading a fixed-size byte slice and a variable-size byte slice from the input data.

### spongeDb

The `spongeDb` struct is a dummy database backend that accumulates writes in a sponge hash. It implements the `ethdb.Database` interface and has methods for putting, getting, and deleting key-value pairs. It is used for testing and debugging purposes.

### spongeBatch

The `spongeBatch` struct is a dummy batch that immediately writes to the underlying `spongeDb`. It implements the `ethdb.Batch` interface and has methods for putting and deleting key-value pairs. It is used for testing and debugging purposes.

### kv

The `kv` struct represents a key-value pair. It is used for sorting key-value pairs in the `stackTrie` struct.

### kvs

The `kvs` type is a slice of `kv` structs. It is used for sorting key-value pairs in the `stackTrie` struct.

### Fuzz

The `Fuzz` function is the fuzzing entry-point. It takes a byte slice as input and returns an integer. It calls the `Execute` function from the `runtime` package with the input byte slice as the code, the input byte slice as the input data, and a `Config` struct with a gas limit of 12000000. If there is an error during execution and the error message starts with "invalid", it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns 1.

The `fuzzer` package provides functionality for fuzzing Ethereum trie data structures. It includes methods for generating random key-value pairs and inserting them into a trie, as well as methods for comparing the results of different trie implementations.

### Fuzz

The `Fuzz` function is the basic entry point for the go-fuzz tool. It takes a byte slice as input and returns an integer. It creates two trie data structures, one using a standard implementation and one using a stack-based implementation. It then generates random key-value pairs and inserts them into both trie data structures. It compares the root hashes of the two trie data structures and panics if they are not equal. It also checks that all nodes in the trie data structures are persisted correctly and panics if any inconsistencies are found. It returns 1 if the input is useful and 0 otherwise.

### Debug

The `Debug` function is similar to the `Fuzz` function, but it also prints out the key-value pairs being inserted into the stack-based trie data structure for debugging purposes. It takes a byte slice as input and returns an integer.
