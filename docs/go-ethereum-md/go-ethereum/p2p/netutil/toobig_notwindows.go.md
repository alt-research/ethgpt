The code above is a Go package named "netutil" that provides a single function for checking whether an error indicates that a UDP packet didn't fit the receive buffer. The function is only implemented for non-Windows platforms.

The "isPacketTooBig" function takes an error as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the error indicates that a UDP packet didn't fit the receive buffer. However, since this function is only implemented for non-Windows platforms, it always returns false.

This function is used in the "udpConn.ReadFromUDP" function in the "net" package to determine whether an error returned by the "recvfrom" system call indicates that a UDP packet didn't fit the receive buffer. On Windows, this error is represented by the "WSAEMSGSIZE" error code, but on non-Windows platforms, there is no such error code.

Here is an example usage of the "isPacketTooBig" function:

```
err := udpConn.SetReadBuffer(1024)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
buf := make([]byte, 1024)
n, addr, err := udpConn.ReadFromUDP(buf)
if err != nil {
    if isPacketTooBig(err) {
        // Handle packet too big error
    } else {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
// Process received packet
```
