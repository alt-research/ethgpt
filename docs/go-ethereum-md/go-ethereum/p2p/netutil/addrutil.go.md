The code above is a Go package named "netutil" that provides a single function for extracting the IP address from a net.Addr object. The package includes a copyright notice and a license statement.

The "AddrIP" function takes a net.Addr object as its argument and returns the IP address contained in the object. If no address is present, it returns nil. The function uses a type switch to determine the type of the net.Addr object and extract the IP address accordingly. It supports three types of net.Addr objects: net.IPAddr, net.TCPAddr, and net.UDPAddr.

Here is an example usage of the "AddrIP" function:

```
addr := &net.TCPAddr{IP: net.ParseIP("127.0.0.1"), Port: 8080}
ip := netutil.AddrIP(addr)
if ip != nil {
    fmt.Println(ip.String())
}
```
