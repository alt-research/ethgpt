This is a Go source code file that implements the NAT-PMP protocol. The code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License. The file defines a struct type `pmp` that adapts the NAT-PMP protocol implementation to conform to a common interface. The `pmp` struct has three methods: `String()`, `ExternalIP()`, and `AddMapping()`. The `String()` method returns a string representation of the `pmp` struct. The `ExternalIP()` method returns the external IP address of the NAT device. The `AddMapping()` method adds a port mapping to the NAT device.

The `discoverPMP()` function returns an instance of the `pmp` struct that represents the NAT device. The function first gets a list of potential gateways and then runs external address lookups on all of them. The function returns the first NAT device that responds.

The `potentialGateways()` function returns a list of potential gateways. The function gets a list of network interfaces and their addresses. For each address, the function checks if it is a private IP address and if it is, it gets the network address and adds it to the list of potential gateways.

# NAT-PMP Protocol Implementation

This is a Go source code file that implements the NAT-PMP protocol. The code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

## pmp Struct

The file defines a struct type `pmp` that adapts the NAT-PMP protocol implementation to conform to a common interface. The `pmp` struct has three methods:

### String()

```go
func (n *pmp) String() string
```

The `String()` method returns a string representation of the `pmp` struct.

### ExternalIP()

```go
func (n *pmp) ExternalIP() (net.IP, error)
```

The `ExternalIP()` method returns the external IP address of the NAT device.

### AddMapping()

```go
func (n *pmp) AddMapping(protocol string, extport, intport int, name string, lifetime time.Duration) error
```

The `AddMapping()` method adds a port mapping to the NAT device.

## discoverPMP() Function

```go
func discoverPMP() Interface
```

The `discoverPMP()` function returns an instance of the `pmp` struct that represents the NAT device. The function first gets a list of potential gateways and then runs external address lookups on all of them. The function returns the first NAT device that responds.

## potentialGateways() Function

```go
func potentialGateways() (gws []net.IP)
```

The `potentialGateways()` function returns a list of potential gateways. The function gets a list of network interfaces and their addresses. For each address, the function checks if it is a private IP address and if it is, it gets the network address and adds it to the list of potential gateways.
``` Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! 

The code you provided is a function that takes in a slice of IP addresses and returns a slice of gateway IP addresses. Let's break it down step by step:

```
func getGateways(ips [][]byte) [][]byte {
```

This line defines a function called `getGateways` that takes in a slice of byte slices (which represent IP addresses) and returns a slice of byte slices (which represent gateway IP addresses).

```
var gws [][]byte
```

This line initializes an empty slice of byte slices called `gws`, which will eventually hold the gateway IP addresses.

```
for _, ip := range ips {
```

This line starts a loop that iterates over each IP address in the `ips` slice.

```
if len(ip) == 4 {
```

This line checks if the length of the current IP address is 4 bytes (which is the length of an IPv4 address).

```
if ip[3] == 0 {
```

This line checks if the last byte of the current IP address is 0 (which is the network address).

```
ip[3] = ip[3] | 0x01
```

This line sets the last byte of the current IP address to be the broadcast address by ORing it with 0x01.

```
gws = append(gws, ip)
```

This line appends the modified IP address to the `gws` slice.

```
}
			}
		}
	}
	return gws
}
```

Finally, the function returns the `gws` slice, which now contains all of the gateway IP addresses.

Here's an example of how you could document this function in Markdown format:

```
# getGateways

This function takes in a slice of byte slices representing IP addresses and returns a slice of byte slices representing gateway IP addresses.

## Parameters

- `ips` ([][]byte): A slice of byte slices representing IP addresses.

## Returns

- ([][]byte): A slice of byte slices representing gateway IP addresses.

## Description

This function iterates over each IP address in the `ips` slice and checks if it is an IPv4 address. If it is, it checks if the last byte of the IP address is the network address (0). If it is, it sets the last byte of the IP address to be the broadcast address (ORing it with 0x01) and appends the modified IP address to the `gws` slice. Finally, the function returns the `gws` slice, which contains all of the gateway IP addresses.

## Example

```go
ips := [][]byte{
	{192, 168, 0, 0},
	{192, 168, 1, 0},
	{192, 168, 2, 0},
	{192, 168, 3, 0},
}
gws := getGateways(ips)
fmt.Println(gws) // Output: [[192 168 0 1] [192 168 1 1] [192 168 2 1] [192 168 3 1]]
```
