This codebase contains a Go implementation of a DNS-based discovery protocol for Ethereum nodes. The code defines a `Tree` struct that represents a merkle tree of node records. The struct has the following fields:

1. `root *rootEntry`: a pointer to the root entry of the tree.
2. `entries map[string]entry`: a map that stores all the entries in the tree.

The struct has the following methods:

1. `func (t *Tree) Sign(key *ecdsa.PrivateKey, domain string) (url string, err error)`: This method signs the tree with the given private key and sets the sequence number. It returns a URL string that can be used to retrieve the signed tree, or an error if the signing fails. The method first creates a copy of the root entry, signs the hash of the entry using the private key, and assigns the signature to the copy. It then creates a new link entry with the given domain and public key, and returns the string representation of the link entry.

2. `func (t *Tree) SetSignature(pubkey *ecdsa.PublicKey, signature string) error`: This method verifies the given signature and assigns it as the tree's current signature if valid. It takes a public key and a signature string as input, and returns an error if the signature is invalid. The method first creates a copy of the root entry, assigns the given signature to the copy, and verifies the signature using the public key. If the signature is valid, the method assigns the copy to the tree's root entry.

3. `func (t *Tree) Seq() uint`: This method returns the sequence number of the tree.

4. `func (t *Tree) Signature() string`: This method returns the signature of the tree as a base64-encoded string.

5. `func (t *Tree) ToTXT(domain string) map[string]string`: This method returns all DNS TXT records required for the tree. It takes a domain string as input, and returns a map of subdomains and their corresponding TXT records. The map includes the root entry and all other entries in the tree.

6. `func (t *Tree) Links() []string`: This method returns all links contained in the tree as a slice of string representations.

7. `func (t *Tree) Nodes() []*enode.Node`: This method returns all nodes contained in the tree as a slice of `enode.Node` structs.

The code also defines several helper functions and constants:

1. `type linkEntry`: a struct that represents a link entry in the tree. It has the following fields:
   - `domain string`: the domain name of the link.
   - `pubkey *ecdsa.PublicKey`: a pointer to the public key of the link.
   - `seq uint`: the sequence number of the link.
   - `sig []byte`: the signature of the link.

   The struct has the following methods: This codebase contains functions and types related to creating and encoding a tree structure for Ethereum nodes. The functions are:

1. `func MakeTree(seq uint, nodes []*enode.Node, links []string) (*Tree, error)`: This function takes a sequence number `seq`, a slice of Ethereum nodes `nodes`, and a slice of links `links`, and creates a tree containing the nodes and links. The function first sorts the nodes by ID and ensures that all nodes have a valid record. It then creates a leaf list of entries for the nodes and links. It builds intermediate nodes by recursively grouping entries into branches until each branch has at most `maxChildren` entries. The function returns a pointer to the root of the tree and an error if there is a problem creating the tree.

2. `func sortByID(nodes []*enode.Node) []*enode.Node`: This function takes a slice of Ethereum nodes `nodes` and sorts them by ID. It returns the sorted slice.

The types are:

1. `type Tree struct`: This type represents a tree structure containing entries for Ethereum nodes and links. It has the following fields:
   - `root *rootEntry`: a pointer to the root entry of the tree.
   - `entries map[string]entry`: a map of subdomain hashes to entries.

   The type has the following methods:
   - `func (t *Tree) build(entries []entry) entry`: This method takes a slice of entries `entries` and recursively builds intermediate nodes by grouping entries into branches until each branch has at most `maxChildren` entries. It returns the root entry of the resulting tree.
   - `func subdomain(e entry) string`: This method takes an entry `e` and returns its subdomain hash.
   
2. `type entry interface`: This interface represents an entry in the tree structure. It has a `String()` method that returns a string representation of the entry.

3. `type rootEntry struct`: This type represents the root entry of the tree. It has the following fields:
   - `eroot string`: the subdomain hash of the root of the Ethereum node entries.
   - `lroot string`: the subdomain hash of the root of the link entries.
   - `seq uint`: the sequence number of the tree.
   - `sig []byte`: the signature of the tree.

   The type has the following methods:
   - `func (e *rootEntry) sigHash() []byte`: This method returns the hash of the root entry for signature verification.
   - `func (e *rootEntry) verifySignature(pubkey *ecdsa.PublicKey) This codebase contains functions that deal with parsing and encoding entries in an ENR tree. An ENR tree is a tree structure where each node is an ENR (Ethereum Name Record) that contains information about a node in the Ethereum network. The functions are:

1. `func (e *linkEntry) String() string`: This method returns a string representation of a linkEntry. It returns the linkPrefix followed by the string representation of the linkEntry.

2. `func (e *linkEntry) String() string`: This method returns a string representation of a linkEntry. It returns the linkPrefix followed by the string representation of the linkEntry.

3. `func newLinkEntry(domain string, pubkey *ecdsa.PublicKey) *linkEntry`: This function creates a new linkEntry with the given domain and public key. It first compresses the public key using `crypto.CompressPubkey()`, then encodes it using `b32format.EncodeToString()`. It then concatenates the encoded public key, the "@" symbol, and the domain to create the string representation of the linkEntry. It returns a pointer to the new linkEntry.

4. `func parseEntry(e string, validSchemes enr.IdentityScheme) (entry, error)`: This function takes a string `e` and an `enr.IdentityScheme` `validSchemes`, and parses the string into an entry. It first checks the prefix of the string to determine the type of entry. If the prefix is `linkPrefix`, it calls `parseLinkEntry()`. If the prefix is `branchPrefix`, it calls `parseBranch()`. If the prefix is `enrPrefix`, it calls `parseENR()`. Otherwise, it returns an error.

5. `func parseRoot(e string) (rootEntry, error)`: This function takes a string `e` and parses it into a rootEntry. The string should have the format "root e=<eroot> l=<lroot> seq=<seq> sig=<sig>". It uses `fmt.Sscanf()` to parse the string into its components. It then checks if the `eroot` and `lroot` components are valid hashes using `isValidHash()`. It decodes the `sig` component from base64 using `b64format.DecodeString()`. It returns a rootEntry with the parsed components.

6. `func parseLinkEntry(e string) (entry, error)`: This function takes a string `e` and parses it into a linkEntry. It calls `parseLink()` to parse the string into its components. It returns a pointer to the new linkEntry.

7. `func parseLink(e string) (*linkEntry, error)`: This function takes a string `e` and parses it into a linkEntry. It first checks if the string has the correct scheme
