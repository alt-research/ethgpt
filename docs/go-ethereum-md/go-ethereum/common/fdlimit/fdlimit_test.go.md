### TestFileDescriptorLimits()

```go
func TestFileDescriptorLimits(t *testing.T)
```

`TestFileDescriptorLimits()` is a test function that checks whether the file descriptor allowance per this process can be retrieved. The function first retrieves the maximum file descriptor limit for the system and checks whether it is greater than or equal to a target value of 4096. If the system limit is less than the target value, the test is skipped. Otherwise, the function retrieves the current file descriptor limit and checks whether it is greater than 0. Then, the function raises the file descriptor allowance to the target value and checks whether the new file descriptor limit is equal to the target value. If any of these checks fail, the test function fails with a fatal error.
