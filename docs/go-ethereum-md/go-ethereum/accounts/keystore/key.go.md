## Keystore Package

The `keystore` package provides functionality for managing Ethereum private keys and their associated addresses. It defines the `Key` struct, which represents an Ethereum private key, and the `keyStore` interface, which defines methods for loading and storing keys.

### Key

The `Key` struct represents an Ethereum private key. It has the following fields:

- `Id uuid.UUID`: a unique identifier for the key.
- `Address common.Address`: the Ethereum address associated with the key.
- `PrivateKey *ecdsa.PrivateKey`: the private key itself.

The `Key` struct also implements the `json.Marshaler` and `json.Unmarshaler` interfaces to allow for easy serialization and deserialization of keys.

### keyStore

The `keyStore` interface defines methods for loading and storing keys. It has the following methods:

- `GetKey(addr common.Address, filename string, auth string) (*Key, error)`: loads and decrypts a key from disk.
- `StoreKey(filename string, k *Key, auth string) error`: writes and encrypts a key to disk.
- `JoinPath(filename string) string`: joins a filename with the key directory unless it is already absolute.

### plainKeyJSON

The `plainKeyJSON` struct represents a key in JSON format. It has the following fields:

- `Address string`: the Ethereum address associated with the key.
- `PrivateKey string`: the private key itself, encoded as a hexadecimal string.
- `Id string`: a unique identifier for the key, encoded as a UUID string.
- `Version int`: the version of the key format.

### encryptedKeyJSONV3

The `encryptedKeyJSONV3` struct represents an encrypted key in JSON format. It has the following fields:

- `Address string`: the Ethereum address associated with the key.
- `Crypto CryptoJSON`: the encrypted private key and associated parameters.
- `Id string`: a unique identifier for the key, encoded as a UUID string.
- `Version int`: the version of the key format.

### encryptedKeyJSONV1

The `encryptedKeyJSONV1` struct represents an encrypted key in JSON format. It has the following fields:

- `Address string`: the Ethereum address associated with the key.
- `Crypto CryptoJSON`: the encrypted private key and associated parameters.
- `Id string`: a unique identifier for the key, encoded as a UUID string.
- `Version string`: the version of the key format, encoded as a string.

### CryptoJSON

The `CryptoJSON` struct represents the encrypted private key and associated parameters in JSON format. It has the following ## Key Generation

The `NewKey` function generates a new key by generating a new ECDSA private key using the `crypto.S256()` curve and a random source provided by the `rand` parameter. It then creates a new `Key` struct using the generated private key and returns it.

The `NewKeyForDirectICAP` function generates a new key whose address fits into 155 bits so it can fit into the Direct ICAP spec. It generates a new ECDSA private key using the `crypto.S256()` curve and a random source provided by the `rand` parameter. It then creates a new `Key` struct using the generated private key and checks if the address starts with "0x00". If it does not, it recursively calls itself until it generates a key with an address that starts with "0x00".

The `newKey` function generates a new key by generating a new ECDSA private key using the `crypto.S256()` curve and a random source provided by the `rand` parameter. It then creates a new `Key` struct using the generated private key and returns it along with an empty `accounts.Account` struct.

The `storeNewKey` function generates a new key using the `newKey` function and stores it in the provided `keyStore` using the provided `auth` string as the passphrase. It then creates a new `accounts.Account` struct using the generated key's address and URL and returns it along with the generated key.

## Key File Management

The `writeTemporaryKeyFile` function writes the provided `content` to a temporary file with a name starting with a dot and ending with `.tmp` in the same directory as the provided `file`. It then returns the name of the temporary file.

The `writeKeyFile` function writes the provided `content` to the provided `file` by first writing it to a temporary file using the `writeTemporaryKeyFile` function and then renaming the temporary file to the provided `file`.

The `keyFileName` function returns the name of the key file for the provided `keyAddr` by using the naming convention `UTC--<created_at UTC ISO8601>-<address hex>`.

The `toISO8601` function returns the provided `time.Time` in the ISO8601 format with the timezone offset. It first determines the timezone offset and then formats the time in the `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.nnnnnnnnnZ` format if the timezone is UTC or `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.nnnnnnnnn+hh00` format if it is not.
