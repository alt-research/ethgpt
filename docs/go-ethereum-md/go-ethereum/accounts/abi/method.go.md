The `abi` package provides functionality for encoding and decoding data according to the Ethereum Application Binary Interface (ABI) specification. The package includes a `Method` struct that represents a callable method in a contract, along with its input and output arguments.

The `Method` struct has the following fields:
- `Name`: the method name used for internal representation. It's derived from the raw name and a suffix will be added in the case of a function overload.
- `RawName`: the raw method name parsed from ABI.
- `Type`: indicates whether the method is a special fallback introduced in solidity v0.6.0.
- `StateMutability`: indicates the mutability state of method, the default value is nonpayable. It can be empty if the ABI is generated by legacy compiler.
- `Constant`: indicates whether the method is a constant function.
- `Payable`: indicates whether the method is payable.
- `Inputs`: the required input parameters for this method.
- `Outputs`: the output parameters for this method.
- `Sig`: returns the method's string signature according to the ABI spec.
- `ID`: returns the canonical representation of the method's signature used by the ABI definition to identify method names and types.

The `abi` package includes the following functions:
- `NewMethod(name string, rawName string, funType FunctionType, mutability string, isConst, isPayable bool, inputs Arguments, outputs Arguments) Method`: creates a new `Method` struct.
- `pack(args ...interface{}) ([]byte, error)`: packs the given arguments into a byte slice according to the ABI specification.
- `unpack(dest []interface{}, data []byte) error`: unpacks the given byte slice into the provided destination slice according to the ABI specification.
- `MethodID(name string) []byte`: returns the method ID for the given method name.
- `EventID(name string, types []string) []byte`: returns the event ID for the given event name and types.
- `MethodSignature(name string, args ...interface{}) string`: returns the method signature for the given method name and arguments.
- `EventSignature(name string, args ...interface{}) string`: returns the event signature for the given event name and arguments.
- `SelectorFromFunc(fn interface{}) (ret [4]byte)`: returns the function selector for the given function.
- `SelectorByID(id []byte) (ret [4]byte)`: returns the function selector for the given method ID. ## Function Description

The `Method` struct represents a Solidity function or contract method. It has the following fields:

- `Name string`: the name of the method.
- `RawName string`: the raw name of the method.
- `Type MethodType`: the type of the method (Function, Constructor, Fallback, or Receive).
- `StateMutability string`: the state mutability of the method (view, pure, nonpayable, or payable).
- `Constant bool`: whether the method is constant.
- `Payable bool`: whether the method is payable.
- `Inputs []Argument`: the input arguments of the method.
- `Outputs []Argument`: the output arguments of the method.
- `str string`: the string representation of the method.
- `Sig string`: the signature of the method.
- `ID []byte`: the method ID.

The `Method` struct has the following methods:

- `NewMethod(name, rawName string, funType MethodType, mutability string, isConst, isPayable bool, inputs, outputs []Argument) Method`: creates a new method with the given parameters.
- `String() string`: returns the string representation of the method.
- `IsConstant() bool`: returns whether the method is read-only.
- `IsPayable() bool`: returns whether the method can process plain ether transfers.

The `NewMethod` function creates a new method with the given parameters. It calculates the signature and method ID for the method, and generates the string representation of the method.

The `String` method returns the string representation of the method.

The `IsConstant` method returns whether the method is read-only. A method is considered read-only if its state mutability is "view" or "pure", or if it is marked as constant.

The `IsPayable` method returns whether the method can process plain ether transfers. A method is considered payable if its state mutability is "payable", or if it is marked as payable.
