This is a Go program that generates and manipulates Ethereum node keys. The program is licensed under the GNU General Public License and is part of the go-ethereum project.

The program defines a `keyCommand` variable that represents a CLI command for performing operations on node keys. The `keyCommand` variable has four subcommands: `keyGenerateCommand`, `keyToIDCommand`, `keyToNodeCommand`, and `keyToRecordCommand`.

The `keyGenerateCommand` subcommand generates a new node key file and saves it to disk. The `keyToIDCommand` subcommand creates a node ID from an existing node key file. The `keyToNodeCommand` subcommand creates an enode URL from an existing node key file. The `keyToRecordCommand` subcommand creates an ENR (Ethereum Name Record) from an existing node key file.

The `makeRecord` function is a helper function that takes a CLI context and returns an `enode.Node` object. The `enode.Node` object represents an Ethereum node and contains information such as the node's ID, IP address, and port numbers. The `makeRecord` function reads a node key file from disk, extracts the IP address and port numbers from the CLI context, and creates an `enr.Record` object from this information. The `enr.Record` object is then signed with the node's private key to create an `enode.Node` object.

The `genkey` function is a helper function that generates a new node key file and saves it to disk. The function takes a CLI context as an argument and returns an error if the context does not contain a valid key file argument. The function generates a new private key using the `crypto.GenerateKey` function and saves it to disk using the `crypto.SaveECDSA` function.

The `keyToID` function is a subcommand function that creates a node ID from an existing node key file. The function takes a CLI context as an argument and returns an error if the context does not contain a valid key file argument. The function calls the `makeRecord` function to create an `enode.Node` object from the key file, and then prints the node's ID to the console.

The `keyToURL` function is a subcommand function that creates an enode URL from an existing node key file. The function takes a CLI context as an argument and returns an error if the context does not contain a valid key file argument. The function calls the `makeRecord` function to create an `enode.Node` object from the key file, and then prints the node's enode URL to the console.

The `keyToRecord` function is a subcommand function that creates an ENR from an existing node key file. The function takes a CLI context as an argument and returns an error if the context does not contain a valid key file argument. The function calls the `makeRecord` function to create an `enode.Node` object from the key file, and then prints the node's ENR to the console.

Here is an example of how to use the `keyCommand` CLI command:

```
$ go run main.go key generate mykey
$ go run main.go key to-id mykey
$ go run main.go key to-enode mykey --ip 192.168.0.1 --tcp 30303 --udp 30303
$ go run main.go key to-enr mykey --ip 192.168.0.1 --tcp 30303 --udp 30303
```
