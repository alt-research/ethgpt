This is a Go source code file that contains a command-line interface (CLI) tool for running RLPx commands. RLPx is a protocol used for encrypted peer-to-peer communication in Ethereum. The tool provides three subcommands: ping, eth-test, and snap-test.

The `rlpxCommand` variable defines the main command for the tool, which has three subcommands: `rlpxPingCommand`, `rlpxEthTestCommand`, and `rlpxSnapTestCommand`. Each subcommand is defined as a separate `cli.Command` variable.

The `rlpxPing` function is the implementation of the `ping` subcommand. It takes a node argument, which is the IP address and port number of the node to ping. It establishes a TCP connection to the node, creates an RLPx connection, performs a handshake, and reads the response. If the response is a handshake message, it decodes and prints the message. If the response is a disconnect message, it returns an error.

The `rlpxEthTest` function is the implementation of the `eth-test` subcommand. It takes three arguments: the node to test, the path to the `chain.rlp` file, and the path to the `genesis.json` file. It creates an `ethtest.Suite` object with the given arguments and runs the Ethereum protocol test suite using the `runTests` function.

The `rlpxSnapTest` function is the implementation of the `snap-test` subcommand. It takes the same arguments as `rlpxEthTest`. It creates an `ethtest.Suite` object and runs the snapshot protocol test suite using the `runTests` function.

Overall, this code provides a CLI tool for testing RLPx communication with Ethereum nodes and running protocol test suites.
