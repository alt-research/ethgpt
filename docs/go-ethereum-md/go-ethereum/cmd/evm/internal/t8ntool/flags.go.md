### Package: `t8ntool`

The `t8ntool` package provides a command-line tool for testing Ethereum transactions. It includes various flags for configuring the tool's behavior, such as enabling tracing, specifying input and output files, and more.

The package includes the following flags:

- `TraceFlag`: Enables full trace logs to be output to files.
- `TraceDisableMemoryFlag`: Disables full memory dump in traces (deprecated).
- `TraceEnableMemoryFlag`: Enables full memory dump in traces.
- `TraceDisableStackFlag`: Disables stack output in traces.
- `TraceDisableReturnDataFlag`: Disables return data output in traces (deprecated).
- `TraceEnableReturnDataFlag`: Enables return data output in traces.
- `OutputBasedir`: Specifies where output files are placed.
- `OutputBodyFlag`: If set, the RLP of the transactions (block body) will be written to this file.
- `OutputAllocFlag`: Determines where to put the `alloc` of the post-state.
- `OutputResultFlag`: Determines where to put the `result` (stateroot, txroot etc) of the post-state.
- `OutputBlockFlag`: Determines where to put the `block` after building.
- `InputAllocFlag`: Specifies the file name of where to find the prestate alloc to use.
- `InputEnvFlag`: Specifies the file name of where to find the prestate env to use.
- `InputTxsFlag`: Specifies the file name of where to find the transactions to apply.
- `InputHeaderFlag`: Specifies the file name of where to find the block header to use.
- `InputOmmersFlag`: Specifies the file name of where to find the ommers to use.

The package also includes the following functions:

### Variables

The following variables are defined in the code:

- `InputGenesisFlag`: A `cli.StringFlag` variable that represents the input genesis file flag. It has a `Name` field that specifies the name of the flag, and a `Usage` field that provides a description of the flag's purpose.

- `InputOmmersFlag`: A `cli.StringFlag` variable that represents the input ommer header RLPs file flag. It has a `Name` field that specifies the name of the flag, and a `Usage` field that provides a description of the flag's purpose.

- `InputWithdrawalsFlag`: A `cli.StringFlag` variable that represents the input withdrawals file flag. It has a `Name` field that specifies the name of the flag, and a `Usage` field that provides a description of the flag's purpose.

- `InputTxsRlpFlag`: A `cli.StringFlag` variable that represents the input transactions list in RLP form file flag. It has a `Name` field that specifies the name of the flag, a `Usage` field that provides a description of the flag's purpose, and a `Value` field that specifies the default value of the flag.

- `SealCliqueFlag`: A `cli.StringFlag` variable that represents the Clique sealing data file flag. It has a `Name` field that specifies the name of the flag, and a `Usage` field that provides a description of the flag's purpose.

- `SealEthashFlag`: A `cli.BoolFlag` variable that represents the ethash sealing flag. It has a `Name` field that specifies the name of the flag, and a `Usage` field that provides a description of the flag's purpose.

- `SealEthashDirFlag`: A `cli.StringFlag` variable that represents the path to the ethash DAG file flag. It has a `Name` field that specifies the name of the flag, and a `Usage` field that provides a description of the flag's purpose.

- `SealEthashModeFlag`: A `cli.StringFlag` variable that represents the type and amount of PoW verification an ethash engine makes flag. It has a `Name` field that specifies the name of the flag, a `Usage` field that provides a description of the flag's purpose, and a `Value` field that specifies the default value of the flag.

- `RewardFlag`: A `cli.Int64Flag` variable that represents the mining reward flag. It has a `Name` field that specifies the name of the flag, a `Usage` field that provides a description of the flag's purpose, and a `Value` field that specifies the default value of the flag.

- `ChainIDFlag`: A `cli.Int64Flag` variable that represents the ChainID flag. It has a `Name` field that specifies the name of the flag, a `Usage` field that provides a description of the flag's purpose, and a `Value` field that specifies the default value of the flag.

- `ForknameFlag`: A `cli.StringFlag` variable that represents the forkname flag. It has a `Name` field that specifies the name of the flag, a `Usage` field that provides a description of the flag's purpose, and a `Value` field that specifies the default value of the flag.

- `VerbosityFlag`: A `cli.IntFlag` variable that represents the verbosity level flag. It has a `Name` field that specifies the name of the flag, a `Usage` field that provides a description of the flag's purpose, and a `Value` field that specifies the default value of the flag.

These variables are used to define the command-line flags for the `geth` command.

Example usage:

```go
app := &cli.App{
    Flags: []cli.Flag{
        InputGenesisFlag,
        InputOmmersFlag,
        InputWithdrawalsFlag,
        InputTxsRlpFlag,
        SealCliqueFlag,
        SealEthashFlag,
        SealEthashDirFlag,
        SealEthashModeFlag,
        RewardFlag,
        ChainIDFlag,
        ForknameFlag,
