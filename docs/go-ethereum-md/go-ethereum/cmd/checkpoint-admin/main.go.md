This is the main package for the Ethereum checkpoint helper tool. The tool is used to query checkpoint information and register stable checkpoints into an oracle contract. The package imports several other packages, including `fmt`, `os`, `github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/common/fdlimit`, `github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/internal/flags`, and `github.com/urfave/cli/v2`.

The package defines a `var` named `app`, which is an instance of the `flags.App` struct. The `flags.App` struct is used to define the command-line interface for the tool. The `app` variable is initialized with the name "ethereum checkpoint helper tool" and a list of commands and flags.

The package also defines several commonly used command-line flags, including `indexFlag`, `hashFlag`, `oracleFlag`, `thresholdFlag`, `nodeURLFlag`, `clefURLFlag`, `signerFlag`, `signersFlag`, and `signaturesFlag`.

The `main` function sets up logging and raises the file descriptor limit before calling `app.Run` to start the tool. If an error occurs, it is printed to `os.Stderr` and the program exits with a status code of 1.
