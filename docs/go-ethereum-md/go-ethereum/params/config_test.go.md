CheckCompatible function checks if the stored ChainConfig is compatible with the new ChainConfig. It takes in two ChainConfig pointers, stored and new, and the head block and head timestamp as uint64. It returns a ConfigCompatError pointer if the stored and new ChainConfigs are not compatible, otherwise, it returns nil.

The function tests various scenarios where the stored and new ChainConfigs are compared based on their HomesteadBlock, EIP150Block, ConstantinopleBlock, PetersburgBlock, and ShanghaiTime values. If the stored and new ChainConfigs are not compatible, the function returns a ConfigCompatError pointer that contains information about the incompatibility, such as the stored and new block or timestamp values, and the block or timestamp to which the chain should be rewound.

The function uses the reflect package to compare the stored and new ChainConfigs. It checks if the new ChainConfig has any new fields that are not present in the stored ChainConfig. If there are any new fields, the function returns a ConfigCompatError pointer indicating that the new ChainConfig has additional fields.

The function also checks if the stored ChainConfig has any fields that are not present in the new ChainConfig. If there are any missing fields, the function returns a ConfigCompatError pointer indicating that the new ChainConfig is missing fields. ## Function Documentation

### TestLoadChainHead

The `TestLoadChainHead` function tests the `LoadChainHead` function by providing different test cases with different inputs and expected outputs. The function checks if the returned values match the expected values for each test case. If there is a mismatch, the function reports an error.

### TestStoreChainHead

The `TestStoreChainHead` function tests the `StoreChainHead` function by providing different test cases with different inputs and expected outputs. The function checks if the returned errors match the expected errors for each test case. If there is a mismatch, the function reports an error.

### TestConfigRules

The `TestConfigRules` function tests the `Rules` function of the `ChainConfig` struct by providing different test cases with different inputs and expected outputs. The function checks if the returned values match the expected values for each test case. If there is a mismatch, the function reports an error.

## Code Explanation

The code contains three test functions that test different functionalities of the `ChainConfig` and `ChainHeadDB` structs.

The `ChainHeadDB` struct provides a database for storing and retrieving the chain head block and its timestamp. The `LoadChainHead` function retrieves the stored chain head block and its timestamp from the database. The `StoreChainHead` function stores the given chain head block and its timestamp in the database. The test functions `TestLoadChainHead` and `TestStoreChainHead` test these functions by providing different test cases with different inputs and expected outputs.

The `ChainConfig` struct provides configuration rules for the blockchain. The `Rules` function of the `ChainConfig` struct returns the configuration rules for a given block number, whether the block is a Shanghai block, and the timestamp of the block. The test function `TestConfigRules` tests this function by providing different test cases with different inputs and expected outputs.
