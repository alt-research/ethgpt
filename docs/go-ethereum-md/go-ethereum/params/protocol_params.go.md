`NetSstoreNoopGas` is the The code snippet contains a list of constants that define the gas costs for various operations in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The gas cost is a measure of the computational effort required to execute an operation in the EVM. The gas cost is used to prevent infinite loops and to incentivize efficient code.

The gas costs are defined as uint64 constants and are grouped by operation type. Some of the gas costs are specific to certain Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and are labeled accordingly.

The gas costs include:

- ryGasEIP2200: Minimum gas required to be present for an SSTORE call, not consumed
- SstoreSetGasEIP2200: Once per SSTORE operation from clean zero to non-zero
- SstoreResetGasEIP2200: Once per SSTORE operation from clean non-zero to something else
- SstoreClearsScheduleRefundEIP2200: Once per SSTORE operation for clearing an originally existing storage slot
- ColdAccountAccessCostEIP2929: COLD_ACCOUNT_ACCESS_COST
- ColdSloadCostEIP2929: COLD_SLOAD_COST
- WarmStorageReadCostEIP2929: WARM_STORAGE_READ_COST
- SstoreClearsScheduleRefundEIP3529: Once per SSTORE operation for clearing an originally existing storage slot
- JumpdestGas: Once per JUMPDEST operation
- EpochDuration: Duration between proof-of-work epochs
- CreateDataGas: Once per byte of data attached to a CREATE operation
- CallCreateDepth: Maximum depth of call/create stack
- ExpGas: Once per EXP instruction
- Log This code block contains constants related to gas prices for various operations in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Gas is a unit of measurement for the computational effort required to execute an operation or a contract in the EVM. Each operation has a specific gas cost associated with it, which is paid by the user who initiates the operation. The gas cost is calculated based on the complexity of the operation and the amount of resources it consumes.

The constants in this code block define the gas costs for various EVM operations, such as EXTCODEHASH, SELFDESTRUCT, EXP, and EXTENDCOPY. The gas costs for these operations vary depending on the version of the Ethereum protocol and the size of the input data. The code also defines gas costs for precompiled contracts, which are special contracts that perform complex operations such as elliptic curve cryptography.

The gas costs defined in this code block are used by the Ethereum client software to calculate the total gas cost of a transaction or a contract execution. The gas cost is then multiplied by the gas price, which is set by the user, to determine the total cost of the operation in Ether. This code snippet defines several constants and variables related to gas prices, BLS12-381 multi-exponentiation operations, and block difficulty.

The `RefundQuotient` and `RefundQuotientEIP3529` constants define the maximum amount of gas that can be refunded after a transaction is executed. The `BlobTxMinDataGasprice` and `BlobTxDataGaspriceUpdateFraction` constants define the minimum gas price for data blobs and the maximum rate of change for data gas price, respectively.

The `Bls12381MultiExpDiscountTable` variable is an array of 128 uint64 values that represents the gas discount table for BLS12-381 G1 and G2 multi-exponentiation operations.

The `DifficultyBoundDivisor`, `GenesisDifficulty`, `MinimumDifficulty`, and `DurationLimit` variables are related to block difficulty. `DifficultyBoundDivisor` is the bound divisor of the difficulty, used in the update calculations. `GenesisDifficulty` is the difficulty of the Genesis block. `MinimumDifficulty` is the minimum that the difficulty may ever be. `DurationLimit` is the decision boundary on the blocktime duration used to determine whether difficulty should go up or not.
