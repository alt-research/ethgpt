# RPC Package

The RPC package provides a framework for creating remote procedure call (RPC) servers and clients. It is used in the Ethereum ecosystem to expose APIs for interacting with Ethereum nodes.

## Service Registry

The `serviceRegistry` type is used to register and store services that expose RPC methods. A service is a registered object that has one or more methods that can be called remotely. The `registerName` function is used to register a service with a given name. The name is used to identify the service and its methods. The `callback` function is used to retrieve the callback corresponding to a given RPC method name. The `subscription` function is used to retrieve a subscription callback in the given service.

## Callbacks

The `callback` type represents a method callback which was registered in the server. It contains the function, receiver object of the method, input argument types, and whether the method's first argument is a context. It also contains the error return index and whether the callback is a subscription callback.

## Suitable Callbacks

The `suitableCallbacks` function is used to iterate over the methods of a given type and determine if a method satisfies the criteria for a RPC callback or a subscription callback. A method is considered suitable if it has a specific signature and meets certain criteria. For example, a method must have a specific number and type of input arguments, and it must return an error. If a method is suitable, it is added to the collection of callbacks.

## Example Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/rpc"
)

type MyService struct{}

func (s *MyService) MyMethod(ctx context.Context, arg1 string, arg2 int) (string, error) {
	return fmt.Sprintf("arg1: %s, arg2: %d", arg1, arg2), nil
}

func main() {
	srv := rpc.NewServer()
	err := srv.RegisterName("myService", &MyService{})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	// Start the server
	srv.ListenAndServe()
}
```

In this example, we define a `MyService` struct with a single method `MyMethod`. We then create a new RPC server and register the `MyService` instance with the name "myService". Finally, we start the server with `ListenAndServe`. Now, clients can connect to the server and call the `MyMethod` method remotely. This code is a part of a package that provides a framework for setting up multi-protocol Ethereum nodes. The code is responsible for creating a map of callbacks from a given receiver object. The receiver object is a struct that contains methods that can be used as RPC callbacks. The function `newCallback` is responsible for creating a callback object from a given function. It returns nil if the function is unsuitable as an RPC callback. The function `makeArgTypes` composes the argTypes list. The function `call` invokes the callback. It creates the argument slice, runs the callback, and catches any panic while running the callback. The functions `isContextType`, `isErrorType`, `isSubscriptionType`, and `isPubSub` are helper functions that check whether a given type satisfies certain conditions. These functions are used to determine whether a given function can be used as an RPC callback. # Documentation for Source Code

## isSubscriptionMethod

```go
func isSubscriptionMethod(methodType reflect.Type) bool
```

The `isSubscriptionMethod` function takes a `reflect.Type` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the method is a subscription method or not. A subscription method is a method that returns two values, the first being a channel and the second being an error. This function checks if the method type has the correct signature for a subscription method and returns `true` if it does, and `false` otherwise.

## formatName

```go
func formatName(name string) string
```

The `formatName` function takes a string as input and returns a new string with the first character converted to lowercase. This function is used to format the name of a method to conform to Go naming conventions. It converts the first character of the input string to lowercase and returns the resulting string.
