## LoopInterrupt

The `LoopInterrupt` function tests the interrupt of infinite loops in the EVM. It creates a new EVM instance with a block context, transaction context, state database, protocol changes, and configuration. It then creates a new account with a given address and sets its code to a given bytecode. The function then creates a goroutine to execute the EVM call and another goroutine to wait for a timeout. If the EVM call takes more than one second to execute, the timeout goroutine sends a signal to the `timeout` channel. Otherwise, the EVM call returns an error or a result, which is sent to the `errChannel` channel. Finally, the EVM instance is cancelled to interrupt the execution of the infinite loop.

The `loopInterruptTests` variable is an array of bytecode strings that represent infinite loops using the `JUMP` and `JUMPI` instructions.

## TestLoopInterrupt

The `TestLoopInterrupt` function tests the `LoopInterrupt` function with the `loopInterruptTests` array. It creates a new state database and account, sets the account code to the bytecode of each test case, and calls the `LoopInterrupt` function with the EVM instance and the account address. If the EVM call returns an error, the test fails. If the EVM call takes more than
