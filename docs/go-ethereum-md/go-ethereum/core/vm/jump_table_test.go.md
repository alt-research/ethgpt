# VM Package

The `vm` package is a part of the go-ethereum library, which is a free and open-source software for building decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. This package provides a virtual machine for executing Ethereum smart contracts.

## TestJumpTableCopy

The `TestJumpTableCopy` function is a unit test that checks whether a deep copy is necessary to prevent modifying the shared jump table. The test creates a new merge instruction set and checks that the constant gas for the `SLOAD` instruction is equal to 0. Then, it creates a deep copy of the jump table and modifies the constant gas for the `SLOAD` instruction to 100. Finally, it checks that the constant gas for the `SLOAD` instruction in the original jump table is still equal to 0, while the constant gas for the `SLOAD` instruction in the deep copy is equal to 100.

The `require` package is used to check the equality of the constant gas values. The `testing` package is used to define the unit test function.

## Conclusion

The `vm` package provides a virtual machine for executing Ethereum smart contracts. The `TestJumpTableCopy` function is a unit test that checks whether a deep copy is necessary to prevent modifying the shared jump table.
