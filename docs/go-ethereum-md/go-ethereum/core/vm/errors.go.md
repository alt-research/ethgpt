The `vm` package provides an implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) used for executing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The package is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The package defines several errors that can occur during EVM execution, including `ErrOutOfGas`, `ErrDepth`, `ErrInsufficientBalance`, `ErrContractAddressCollision`, `ErrExecutionReverted`, `ErrMaxInitCodeSizeExceeded`, `ErrMaxCodeSizeExceeded`, `ErrInvalidJump`, `ErrWriteProtection`, `ErrReturnDataOutOfBounds`, `ErrGasUintOverflow`, `ErrInvalidCode`, and `ErrNonceUintOverflow`. 

The `ErrStackUnderflow` error is returned when the number of items on the stack is less than the minimum required. The `ErrStackOverflow` error is returned when the number of items on the stack exceeds the maximum allowance. The `ErrInvalidOpCode` error is returned when an invalid opcode is encountered.
