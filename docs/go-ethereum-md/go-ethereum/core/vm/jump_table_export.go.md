## Introduction

This is the source code for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in the Go Ethereum library. The EVM is a virtual machine that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This file contains functions for looking up the instruction set for a given fork, and for determining the minimum and maximum stack requirements for an opcode.

## LookupInstructionSet

The `LookupInstructionSet` function takes a set of rules and returns the instruction set for the fork specified by those rules. It returns an error if the fork is not defined yet. The function uses a switch statement to determine which instruction set to return based on the rules.

## Stack

The `Stack` method of the `operation` type returns the minimum and maximum stack requirements for the opcode. The minimum and maximum stack requirements are stored in the `minStack` and `maxStack` fields of the `operation` type, respectively.

## HasCost

The `HasCost` method of the `operation` type returns true if the opcode has a gas cost. Opcodes that do not have a gas cost are either undefined or the `STOP` opcode.
