## Block Encoding

The `TestBlockEncoding` function tests the encoding of a block. It decodes a block from a hex string, and then checks that the decoded block has the expected values for its fields. 

### Parameters

- `t` - a testing object.

### Return Values

This function does not return any values.

## Variables

This file does not contain any variables.

## Functions

This file does not contain any functions. ## TestEIP1559BlockEncoding

The `TestEIP1559BlockEncoding` function is a test function that tests the encoding and decoding of a block with EIP-1559 transactions. The function first creates a block with a single EIP-1559 transaction and checks that the block's properties are set correctly. It then encodes the block using RLP encoding and checks that the encoded block matches the expected value. Finally, it decodes the encoded block and checks that the decoded block matches the original block.

### Parameters

The function takes a single parameter, `t`, which is a pointer to a `testing.T` instance. This is used to report any errors that occur during the test.

### Variables

The function defines a variable `blockEnc`, which is a byte slice containing the RLP-encoded block data.

### Code

The function first creates a block with a single EIP-1559 transaction using the `NewTransaction` function. It then sets the transaction's signature using the `WithSignature` method and adds the transaction to the block using the `AddTransaction` method.

The function then checks that the block's properties are set correctly using the `check` function. The `check` function takes three parameters: a string describing the property being checked, the actual value of the property, and the expected value of the property. If the actual value does not match the expected value, the function reports an error using the `t.Errorf` method.

The function then encodes the block using RLP encoding and checks that the encoded block matches the expected value using the `bytes.Equal` method.

Finally, the function decodes the encoded block using the `rlp.DecodeBytes` method and checks that the decoded block matches the original block using the `check` function.

## check

The `check` function is a helper function used by the `TestEIP1559BlockEncoding` function to check that a property of a block is set correctly. The function takes three parameters: a string describing the property being checked, the actual value of the property, and the expected value of the property. If the actual value does not match the expected value, the function reports an error using the `t.Errorf` method.

## AccessList

The `AccessList` type is a slice of `AccessTuple` values. An `AccessTuple` represents a single address and a list of storage keys that the address is allowed to access.

## AccessTuple

The `AccessTuple` type represents a single address and a list of storage keys that the address is allowed to access. The `Address` field is a `common.Address` value representing the address, and the `StorageKeys` field is a slice of `common.Hash` values representing the storage keys. ## TestEIP2718BlockEncoding

This function tests the encoding of a block using the EIP-2718 format. The function starts by defining a block encoded in hexadecimal format. The block contains a transaction with dynamic fees and access lists. The function then decodes the block using the RLP library and checks the values of some of its fields. Finally, the function encodes the block again and compares it with the original encoded block.

## Variables

### ss

`ss` is a variable of type `common.Address` that holds the sender's address.

### StorageKeys

`StorageKeys` is a slice of `common.Hash` that holds the storage keys.

### to

`to` is a variable of type `common.Address` that holds the recipient's address.

### txdata

`txdata` is a variable of type `*DynamicFeeTx` that holds the transaction data.

### tx2

`tx2` is a variable of type `*types.Transaction` that holds the transaction.

### blockEnc

`blockEnc` is a variable of type `[]byte` that holds the encoded block.

### block

`block` is a variable of type `Block` that holds the decoded block.

### `TestBlockEncodeDecode`

This function tests the encoding and decoding of a block. It creates a block with two transactions, one of which is a legacy transaction and the other is an access list transaction. It then encodes the block using RLP encoding and checks if the encoded block matches the expected encoded block.

### `TestUncleHash`

### `BenchmarkEncodeBlock`

This function benchmarks the encoding of a block. It creates a block with 70 transactions and encodes it using RLP encoding. It then resets the buffer and repeats the process for the specified number of iterations.

### `newHasher`

This function creates a new instance of the `testHasher` struct, which is a helper tool for transaction/receipt list hashing. It returns a pointer to the new `testHasher` instance.

### `makeBenchBlock`

This function creates a block with 70 transactions, receipts, and uncles. It generates a private key, creates a signer, and signs each transaction using the signer and private key. It then creates a receipt for each transaction and adds them to the receipts list. Finally, it creates three uncle headers and adds them to the uncle list. It returns a pointer to the new block instance.

### `testHasher.Reset`

This method resets the hasher to its initial state.

### `testHasher.Update`

This method updates the hasher with the given key and value.

### `testHasher.Hash`

This method returns the hash of the data that has been updated in the hasher.

### `makeBenchBlock`

It then creates a receipt for each transaction and adds them to the receipts list. Finally, it creates three uncle headers and adds them to the uncle list. It returns a pointer to the new block instance. ## Package `core`
