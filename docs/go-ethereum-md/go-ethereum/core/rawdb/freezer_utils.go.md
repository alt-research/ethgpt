The `rawdb` package contains functions for low-level database operations in the Ethereum blockchain. Here are the descriptions of each function in the package:

### `copyFrom`

`copyFrom` copies data from a source file to a destination file at a specified offset. The destination file is created if it doesn't exist, otherwise it is overwritten. Before the copy is executed, there is a callback that can be registered to manipulate the destination file. It is perfectly valid to have the destination file be the same as the source file.

```go
func copyFrom(srcPath, destPath string, offset uint64, before func(f *os.File) error) error
```

###### Parameters

- `srcPath` - the path to the source file.
- `destPath` - the path to the destination file.
- `offset` - the offset in the source file to start copying from.
- `before` - a callback function that is executed before the copy is executed. It takes a file pointer as an argument and returns an error.

###### Return Values

- `error` - an error, if any.

### `openFreezerFileForAppend`

`openFreezerFileForAppend` opens a freezer table file and seeks to the end.

```go
func openFreezerFileForAppend(filename string) (*os.File, error)
```

###### Parameters

- `filename` - the path to the freezer table file.

###### Return Values

- `*os.File` - a file pointer to the
