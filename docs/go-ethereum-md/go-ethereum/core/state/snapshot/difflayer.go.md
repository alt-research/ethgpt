## Snapshot

The `snapshot` package provides functionality for creating and managing snapshots of the state of the Ethereum blockchain. It includes an aggregator layer that aggregates writes to the state until it is flushed to disk, and a bloom filter that is used to check if an account or storage slot exists in the state.

### Variables

- `aggregatorMemoryLimit`: The maximum size of the bottom-most diff layer that aggregates the writes from above until it's flushed into the disk layer.
- `aggregatorItemLimit`: An approximate number of items that will end up in the aggregator layer before it's flushed out to disk.
- `bloomTargetError`: The target false positive rate when the aggregator layer is at its fullest.
- `bloomSize`: The ideal bloom filter size given the maximum number of items it's expected to hold and the target false positive error rate.
- `bloomFuncs`: The ideal number of bits a single entry should set in the bloom filter to keep its size to a minimum.
- `bloomDestructHasherOffset`: The bloom offset for destruct hashes.
- `bloomAccountHasherOffset`: The bloom offset for account hashes.
- `bloomStorageHasherOffset`: The bloom offset for storage hashes.

## Diff Layer

The `diffLayer` struct represents a collection of modifications made to a state snapshot after running a block on top. It contains one sorted list for the account trie and one-one list for each storage tries. The goal of a diff layer is to act as a journal, tracking recent modifications made to the state, that have not yet graduated into a semi-immutable state.

### Fields

- `origin`: The base disk layer to directly use on bloom misses.
- `parent`: The parent snapshot modified by this one, never nil.
- `memory`: An approximate guess as to how much memory we use.
- `root`: The root hash to which this snapshot diff belongs to.
- `stale`: A signal that the layer became stale (state progressed).
- `destructSet`: A very special helper marker. If an account is marked as deleted, then it's recorded in this set. However, it's allowed that an account is included here but still available in other sets (e.g. storageData).
- `accountList`: A list of account for iteration. If it exists, it's sorted, otherwise it's nil.
- `accountData`: Keyed accounts for direct retrieval (nil means deleted).
- `storageList`: A list of storage slots for iterated retrievals, one per account. Any existing lists are sorted if non-nil.
- `storageData`: Keyed storage slots for direct retrieval. One per account (nil means deleted).
- `diffed`: A bloom filter tracking all the diffed items up to the disk layer.
- `lock`: A read-write mutex.

### Methods

#### Destruct Bloom Hasher

```go
func (h destructBloomHasher) Sum64() uint64
```

`Sum64` is a method of the `destructBloomHasher` type. It returns a 64-bit mini hash of a destruct event.

#### Account Bloom Hasher

```go
func (h accountBloomHasher) Sum64() uint64
```

`Sum64` is a method of the `accountBloomHasher` type. It returns a 64-bit mini hash of an account hash. The given code is a part of the Ethereum Go implementation and is written in the Go programming language. The code is responsible for creating a new diff on top of an existing snapshot, whether that's a low level persistent database or a hierarchical diff already. The code defines two types of bloom filters, `accountBloomHasher` and `storageBloomHasher`, which are used to convert an account hash and a storage hash into a 64-bit mini hash. The `newDiffLayer` function creates a new layer with some pre-allocated data segments. It takes a parent snapshot, root hash, destructs, accounts, and storage as input parameters. The function creates a new layer with some pre-allocated data segments and reblooms the layer's current bloom from scratch based on the parent's and the local diffs. The `rebloom` function discards the layer's current bloom and rebuilds it from scratch based on the parent's and the local diffs. It retrieves the parent bloom or creates a fresh empty one and iterates over all the accounts and storage slots and indexes them. The `panic` function is used to indicate that the function is not implemented. ## Snapshot Package

The `Snapshot` package provides a way to store and retrieve snapshots of the Ethereum state. It is used to optimize state queries by providing a way to retrieve a snapshot of the state at a specific block height. The package contains several types and functions that are used to create and manage snapshots.

### DiffLayer

The `DiffLayer` type represents a layer in the snapshot hierarchy. It contains the differences between the current state and the previous state. It is used to optimize state queries by providing a way to retrieve a snapshot of the state at a specific block height. The `DiffLayer` type has several methods that are used to retrieve account and storage data from the snapshot.

#### Account

The `Account` method retrieves the account associated with a particular hash in the snapshot slim data format. It returns an error if the account is not found.

#### AccountRLP

The `AccountRLP` method retrieves the account RLP associated with a particular hash in the snapshot slim data format. It returns an error if the account is not found. Note that the returned account is not a copy, so it should not be modified.

#### Root

The `Root` method returns the root hash for which this snapshot was made.

#### Parent

The `Parent` method returns the subsequent layer of a diff layer.

#### Stale

The `Stale` method returns whether this layer has become stale (was flattened across) or if it's still live.

#### Storage

The `Storage` method retrieves the storage data associated with a particular hash, within a particular account. If the slot is unknown to this diff, its parent is consulted. Note that the returned slot is not a copy, so it should not be modified.

### Account

The `Account` type represents an Ethereum account. It contains the balance, nonce, and storage data associated with the account.

### AccountRLP

The `AccountRLP` type represents an Ethereum account in RLP format. It is used to store and retrieve account data from the snapshot.

### Snapshot

The `Snapshot` type represents a snapshot of the Ethereum state at a specific block height. It contains a root hash and a diff layer that represents the differences between the current state and the previous state.

#### NewSnapshot

The `NewSnapshot` function creates a new snapshot of the Ethereum state at a specific block height. It takes a state database and a block number as input and returns a new snapshot.

#### Account

The `Account` method retrieves the account associated with a particular hash in the snapshot slim data format. It returns an error if the account is not found.

#### AccountRLP

The `AccountRLP` method retrieves the account RLP associated with a particular hash in the snapshot slim data format. It returns an error if the account is not found. Note that the returned account is not a copy, so it should not be modified.

#### Root

The `Root` method returns the root hash for which this snapshot was made.

#### Parent

The `Parent` method returns the subsequent layer of a diff layer.

#### Stale

The `Stale` method returns whether this layer has become stale (was flattened across) or if it's still live.

#### Storage

The `Storage` method retrieves the storage data associated with a particular hash, within a particular account. If the slot is unknown to this diff, its parent is consulted. Note that the returned slot is not a copy, so it should not be modified.

### Conclusion

The `Snapshot` package provides a way to store and retrieve snapshots of the Ethereum state. It is used to optimize state queries by providing a way to retrieve a snapshot of the state at a specific block height. The package contains several types and functions that are used to create and manage snapshots. The `DiffLayer` type represents a layer in the snapshot hierarchy and contains the differences between the current state and the previous state. The `Account` and `AccountRLP` types represent Ethereum accounts and are used to store and retrieve account data from the snapshot. The `Snapshot` type represents a snapshot of the Ethereum state at a specific block height and contains a root hash and a diff layer that represents the differences between the current state and the previous state. ## diffLayer

The `diffLayer` struct represents a layer in the snapshot diff tree. It is used to store the differences between the current state and a snapshot state. It contains a bloom filter to optimize storage lookups, and it can be flattened to merge all the diffs into a single snapshot.

### Fields

- `lock`: A read-write lock used to synchronize access to the layer.
- `origin`: The original disk layer.
- `parent`: The parent layer.
- `diffed`: The bloom filter used to optimize storage lookups.
- `storageData`: The storage data.
- `destructSet`: The destructed accounts.
- `blockRoot`: The block root.
- `stale`: Whether the layer is stale.

### Methods

#### Storage

```go
func (dl *diffLayer) Storage(accountHash, storageHash common.Hash) ([]byte, error)
```

`Storage` retrieves the storage data for an account and a storage slot.

#### storage

```go
func (dl *diffLayer) storage(accountHash, storageHash common.Hash, depth int) ([]byte, error)
```

`storage` is an internal version of `Storage` that skips the bloom filter checks and uses the internal maps to try and retrieve the data. It's meant to be used if a higher layer's bloom filter hit already.

#### Update

```go
func (dl *diffLayer) Update(blockRoot common.Hash, destructs map[common.Hash]struct{}, accounts map[common.Hash][]byte, storage map[common.Hash]map[common.Hash][]byte) *diffLayer
```

`Update` creates a new layer on top of the existing snapshot diff tree with the specified data items.

#### flatten

```go
func (dl *diffLayer) flatten() snapshot
```

`flatten` pushes all data from this point downwards, flattening everything into a single diff at the bottom. Since usually the lowermost diff is the largest, the flattening builds up from there in reverse. The code provided is a part of the Ethereum Go implementation, specifically the `state_diff.go` file. The file contains the implementation of the `diffLayer` struct and its methods. The `diffLayer` struct is used to represent the difference between two states in the Ethereum state trie. 

### `diffLayer` struct

The `diffLayer` struct represents the difference between two states in the Ethereum state trie. It contains the following fields:

- `parent`: The parent diff layer.
- `origin`: The origin diff layer.
- `root`: The root hash of the diff layer.
- `destructSet`: A set of hashes of accounts that have been deleted in this diff layer.
- `accountData`: A map of account hashes to their corresponding account data in this diff layer.
- `storageData`: A map of account hashes to their corresponding storage data in this diff layer.
- `storageList`: A map of account hashes to their corresponding sorted list of storage slot hashes in this diff layer.
- `diffed`: A flag indicating whether this diff layer has been diffed.
- `memory`: The memory usage of this diff layer.

The `diffLayer` struct has the following methods:

#### `newDiffLayer`

```go
func newDiffLayer(parent *diffLayer, origin *diffLayer) *diffLayer
```

`newDiffLayer` creates a new `diffLayer` instance with the given parent and origin diff layers.

#### `copy`

```go
func (dl *diffLayer) copy() *diffLayer
```

`copy` creates a copy of the `diffLayer` instance.

#### `flattenInto`

```go
func (dl *diffLayer) flattenInto(parent *diffLayer) *diffLayer
```

`flattenInto` flattens the `diffLayer` instance into the given parent diff layer. It returns the resulting parent diff layer.

#### `AccountList`

```go
func (dl *diffLayer) AccountList() []common.Hash
```

`AccountList` returns a sorted list of all accounts in this diff layer, including the deleted ones.

#### `StorageList`

```go
func (dl *diffLayer) StorageList(accountHash common.Hash) ([]common.Hash, bool)
```

`StorageList` returns a sorted list of all storage slot hashes in this diff layer for the given account. If the whole storage is destructed in this layer, then an additional flag `destructed = true` will be returned, otherwise the flag is false. Besides, the returned list will include the hash of deleted storage slot. Note a special case is an account is deleted in a prior tx but is recreated in the following tx with some storage slots set. In this case, the returned list is not empty but the flag is true. ## Function: deepCopyStateObjects
