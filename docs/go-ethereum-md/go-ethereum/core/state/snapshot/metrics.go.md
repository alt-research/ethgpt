## Snapshot Package

The `snapshot` package provides functionality for generating and managing state snapshots in the Ethereum blockchain. It includes metrics for measuring the performance of snapshot generation.

### Metrics

The `snapshot` package includes several metrics for measuring the performance of snapshot generation. These metrics include:

- `snapGeneratedAccountMeter`: Measures the number of accounts generated during snapshot generation.
- `snapRecoveredAccountMeter`: Measures the number of accounts recovered during snapshot generation.
- `snapWipedAccountMeter`: Measures the number of accounts wiped during snapshot generation.
- `snapMissallAccountMeter`: Measures the number of accounts that were not found during snapshot generation.
- `snapGeneratedStorageMeter`: Measures the number of storage entries generated during snapshot generation.
- `snapRecoveredStorageMeter`: Measures the number of storage entries recovered during snapshot generation.
- `snapWipedStorageMeter`: Measures the number of storage entries wiped during snapshot generation.
- `snapMissallStorageMeter`: Measures the number of storage entries that were not found during snapshot generation.
- `snapDanglingStorageMeter`: Measures the number of dangling storage entries during snapshot generation.
- `snapSuccessfulRangeProofMeter`: Measures the number of successful range proofs during snapshot generation.
- `snapFailedRangeProofMeter`: Measures the number of failed range proofs during snapshot generation.
- `snapAccountProveCounter`: Measures the time spent on account proving during snapshot generation.
- `snapAccountTrieReadCounter`: Measures the time spent on account trie iteration during snapshot generation.
- `snapAccountSnapReadCounter`: Measures the time spent on snapshot account iteration during snapshot generation.
- `snapAccountWriteCounter`: Measures the time spent on writing/updating/deleting accounts during snapshot generation.
- `snapStorageProveCounter`: Measures the time spent on storage proving during snapshot generation.
- `snapStorageTrieReadCounter`: Measures the time spent on storage trie iteration during snapshot generation.
- `snapStorageSnapReadCounter`: Measures the time spent on snapshot storage iteration during snapshot generation.
- `snapStorageWriteCounter`: Measures the time spent on writing/updating storages during snapshot generation.
- `snapStorageCleanCounter`: Measures the time spent on cleaning up storages during snapshot generation.

### Functions

The `snapshot` package does not include any functions. It only includes metrics for measuring the performance of snapshot generation. # StateDB Documentation

The `StateDB` struct is a core component of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that is responsible for storing and managing the state of the blockchain. It is used to store anything within the merkle trie, including contracts and accounts. The `StateDB` struct takes care of caching and storing nested states, and it's the general query interface to retrieve contracts and accounts.

## Fields

- `db`: The database used to store the state.
- `prefetcher`: The trie prefetcher used to optimize trie reads.
- `trie`: The merkle trie used to store the state.
- `hasher`: The keccak hasher used to hash the state.
- `originalRoot`: The pre-state root, before any changes were made.
- `snaps`: The snapshot tree used to store snapshots of the state.
- `snap`: The current snapshot of the state.
- `snapAccounts`: The accounts in the current snapshot of the state.
- `snapStorage`: The storage in the current snapshot of the state.
- `stateObjects`: The live state objects in the current state.
- `stateObjectsPending`: The state objects that have been finalized but not yet written to the trie.
- `stateObjectsDirty`: The state objects that have been modified in the current execution.
- `stateObjectsDestruct`: The state objects that have been destructed in the block.
- `dbErr`: The database error that occurred during a database read.
- `refund`: The refund counter used by state transitioning.
- `thash`: The transaction hash.
- `txIndex`: The transaction index.
- `logs`: The logs generated during the execution.
- `logSize`: The size of the logs generated during the execution.
- `preimages`: The preimages of the hashes.
- `accessList`: The per-transaction access list.
- `transientStorage`: The transient storage.
- `journal`: The journal of state modifications.
- `validRevisions`: The valid revisions of the state.
- `nextRevisionId`: The next revision ID.
