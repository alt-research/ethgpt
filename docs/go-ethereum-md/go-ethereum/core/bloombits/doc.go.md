Hello! Thank you for reaching out to me. I'd be happy to help you with your request. 

The code you provided is the license and package declaration for the bloombits package. The package implements bloom filtering on batches of data. 

To generate professional documentation for the source code, we can use Markdown format. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write. It is widely used for documentation and README files. 

Here is an example of how we can document a function in Markdown format:

## Function Name

Description of the function.

### Parameters

- `param1`: Description of the first parameter.
- `param2`: Description of the second parameter.

### Return Value

Description of the return value.

### Example

```go
// Example code that demonstrates how to use the function.
```

We can use this format to document each function in the bloombits package. Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further assistance.
