This is a Go source code file that contains a package named `miner`. The package provides an implementation of the `unconfirmedBlocks` data structure that maintains locally mined blocks that have not yet reached enough maturity to guarantee chain inclusion. It is used by the miner to provide logs to the user when a previously mined block has a high enough guarantee to not be reorged out of the canonical chain.

The `unconfirmedBlocks` struct has the following fields:

- `chain`: a `chainRetriever` interface that is used to verify whether a previously mined block is part of the canonical chain or not.
- `depth`: an unsigned integer that represents the depth after which to discard previous blocks.
- `blocks`: a `*ring.Ring` object that represents the block infos to allow canonical chain cross checks.
- `lock`: This is a Go function that checks the canonical status of a block that has been mined. The function takes a `set` object as input, which is a `blockSet` struct that contains a linked list of blocks that have been mined but not yet added to the blockchain.

The function retrieves the header of the mined block from the blockchain using the block number, and checks whether the block is on the canonical chain by comparing its hash to the hash of the header. If the block is on the canonical chain, the function logs a message indicating that the block has reached the canonical chain.

If the block is not on the canonical chain, the function checks whether the block is an uncle or a lost block. To do this, it iterates over the blocks in the blockchain starting from the block with the same number as the mined block, up to a maximum depth of `set.depth` blocks. For each block, the function checks whether the block's uncles include the mined block. If the mined block is included as an uncle, the function logs a message indicating that the block has become an uncle. If the mined block is not included as an uncle, the function logs a message indicating that the block has been lost.

Finally, the function drops the mined block out of the linked list by unlinking it from the list and moving the pointer to the next block.

Here is an example of how to use the `checkCanonicalStatus` function:

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/core/types"
)

func main() {
	// Create a blockSet object
	set := blockSet{
		chain: &mockChain{},
		depth: 10,
		blocks: &ring.Ring{
			Value: &types.Block{
				Header: &types.Header{
					Number: big.NewInt(100),
					Hash:   common.HexToHash("0x1234567890abcdef"),
				},
			},
		},
	}

	// Check the canonical status of the mined block
	checkCanonicalStatus(set)
}
```
