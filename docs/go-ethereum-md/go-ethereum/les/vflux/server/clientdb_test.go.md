## NodeDB

The `NodeDB` type is a struct that represents a database of node information. It contains methods for setting and getting node balances, as well as an expiration time for node balances.

`setBalance` is a function that sets the balance of a node. It takes three arguments: `id`, `neg`, and `balance`. `id` is a byte slice that represents the ID of the node. `neg` is a boolean that indicates whether the balance is negative. `balance` is an `utils.ExpiredValue` instance that represents the balance of the node.

### func (ndb *NodeDB) getOrNewBalance(id []byte, neg bool) utils.ExpiredValue

`getOrNewBalance` is a function that gets the balance of a node or creates a new balance if it does not exist. It takes two arguments: `id` and `neg`. `id` is a byte slice that represents the ID of the node. `neg` is a boolean that indicates whether the balance is negative. It returns an `utils.ExpiredValue` instance that represents the balance of the node.

### func (ndb *NodeDB) delBalance(id []byte, neg bool)

`delBalance` is a function that deletes the balance of a node. It takes two arguments: `id` and `neg`. `id` is a byte slice that represents the ID of the node. `neg` is a boolean that indicates whether the balance is negative.

### func (ndb *NodeDB) setExpiration(pos, neg utils.Fixed64)

`setExpiration` is a function that sets the expiration time for node balances. It takes two arguments: `pos` and `neg`. `pos` and `neg` are `utils.Fixed64` instances that represent the expiration time for positive and negative balances, respectively.

### func (ndb *NodeDB) getExpiration() (utils.Fixed64, utils.Fixed64)

`getExpiration` is a function that gets the expiration time for node balances. It returns two `utils.Fixed64` instances that represent the expiration time for positive and negative balances, respectively.

### func (ndb *NodeDB) evict(now mclock.AbsTime)

`evict` is a function that evicts expired node balances. It takes one argument: `now`, which is a `mclock.AbsTime` instance that represents the current time.

### func (ndb *NodeDB) cleanup()

`cleanup` is a function that cleans up expired node balances.

### func (ndb *NodeDB) setCurrencyBalance(id enode.ID, balance currencyBalance)

`setCurrencyBalance` is a function that sets the currency balance of a node. It takes two arguments: `id` and `balance`. `id` is an `enode.ID` instance that represents the ID of the node. `balance` is a `currencyBalance` instance that represents the currency balance of the node.

### func (ndb *NodeDB) getCurrencyBalance(id enode.ID) currencyBalance

`getCurrencyBalance` is a function that gets the currency balance of a node. It takes one argument: `id`, which is an `enode.ID` instance that represents the ID of the node. It returns a `currencyBalance` instance that represents the currency balance of the node.

### func (ndb *NodeDB) setCurrencyExchangeRate(typ string, rate float64)

`setCurrencyExchangeRate` is a function that sets the currency exchange rate. It takes two arguments: `typ` and `rate`. `typ` is a string that represents the currency type. `rate` is a float64 that represents the exchange rate.

### func (ndb *NodeDB) getCurrencyExchangeRate(typ string) float64

`getCurrencyExchangeRate` is a function that gets the currency exchange rate. It takes one argument: `typ`, which is a string that represents the currency type. It returns a float64 that represents the exchange rate.

### func (ndb *NodeDB) setCurrencyExchangeRates(rates map[string]float64)

`setCurrencyExchangeRates` is a function that sets the currency exchange rates. It takes one argument: `rates`, which is a map of string to float64 that represents the exchange rates.

### func (ndb *NodeDB) getCurrencyExchangeRates() map[string]float64

`getCurrencyExchangeRates` is a function that gets the currency exchange rates. It returns a map of string to float64 that represents the exchange rates.

### func (ndb *NodeDB) setCurrencyExchangeRateProvider(provider CurrencyExchangeRateProvider)

`setCurrencyExchangeRateProvider` is a function that sets the currency exchange rate provider. It takes one argument: `provider`, which is a `CurrencyExchangeRateProvider` instance that represents the provider of exchange rates.

### func (ndb *NodeDB) getCurrencyExchangeRateProvider() CurrencyExchangeRateProvider

`getCurrencyExchangeRateProvider` is a function that gets the currency exchange rate provider. It returns a `CurrencyExchangeRateProvider` instance that represents the provider of exchange rates.

### func (ndb *NodeDB) setCurrencyExchangeRateUpdateInterval(interval time.Duration)

`setCurrencyExchangeRateUpdateInterval` is a function that sets the currency exchange rate update interval. It takes one argument: `interval`, which is a `time.Duration` instance that represents the update interval.

### func (ndb *NodeDB) getCurrencyExchangeRateUpdateInterval() time.Duration

`getCurrencyExchangeRateUpdateInterval` is a function that gets the currency exchange rate update interval. It returns a `time.Duration` instance that represents the update interval.

### func (ndb *NodeDB) startCurrencyExchangeRateUpdater()

`startCurrencyExchangeRateUpdater` is a function that starts the currency exchange rate updater.

### func (ndb *NodeDB) stopCurrencyExchangeRateUpdater()

`stopCurrencyExchangeRateUpdater` is a function that stops the currency exchange rate updater.

### func (ndb *NodeDB) updateCurrencyExchangeRates()

`updateCurrencyExchangeRates` is a function that updates the currency exchange rates. It fetches the exchange rates from the provider and sets them in the database. The code snippet provided appears to be a test function for a balance eviction mechanism. The function tests whether the mechanism is able to evict balances that are no longer needed. 

The test function begins by defining a set of test cases, each of which contains an ID, a boolean value indicating whether the balance is negative, and the balance value itself. These test cases are used to set the balances in the balance database (ndb) using the setBalance function. 

The function then waits for a timer to expire, which triggers the balance eviction mechanism to run. The timer is set for one hour plus one minute. Once the timer has expired, the function checks whether the done channel has been closed. If it has not been closed, the function times out and fails. 

The function then checks whether the balance eviction mechanism has correctly evicted the balances that are no longer needed. It does this by checking the value of the iterated variable, which should be equal to the number of test cases (in this case, 8 or 16). If iterated is not equal to the expected value, the function fails. 

Overall, this test function appears to be testing the functionality of a balance eviction mechanism in a balance database. It sets balances using test cases, waits for the mechanism to run, and checks whether the mechanism has correctly evicted balances that are no longer needed.
