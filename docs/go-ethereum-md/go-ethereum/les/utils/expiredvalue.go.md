Hello! I'd be happy to help you with your request. 

The code you provided is a Go package called `utils`. It contains several functions and types that are used to calculate and manage expired values. 

Let's start with the `ExpiredValue` type. This type represents a scalar value that is continuously expired (decreased exponentially) based on the provided logarithmic expiration offset value. The formula for value calculation is: `base*2^(exp-logOffset)`. In order to simplify the calculation of `ExpiredValue`, its value is expressed in the form of an exponent with a base of 2. 

Here's an example of how to use the `ExpiredValue` type:

```
// Create a new ExpiredValue with a base of 100 and an exponent of 10
ev := ExpiredValue{Base: 100, Exp: 10}

// Calculate the value of the ExpiredValue at a given logOffset
logOffset := Fixed64(5)
value := ev.Value(logOffset)
```

The `ExpirationFactor` type is used to calculate the multiplier applicable for additions and the divider for readouts. If `logOffset` changes slowly then it saves some expensive operations to not calculate them for each addition and readout but cache this intermediate form for some time. It is also useful for structures where multiple values are expired with the same `Expirer`.

Here's an example of how to use the `ExpirationFactor` type:

```
// Create a new ExpirationFactor with a logOffset of 5
ef := ExpFactor(Fixed64(5))

// Calculate the value of a base 100 and exponent 10 at the given ExpirationFactor
value := ef.Value(100, 10)
```

The `Add` function is used to add a signed value at the given moment. It takes an `amount` parameter, which is the value to add, and a `logOffset` parameter, which is the current logarithmic expiration offset value. 

Here's an example of how to use the `Add` function:

```
// Create a new ExpiredValue with a base of 100 and an exponent of 10
ev := ExpiredValue{Base: 100, Exp: 10}

// Add 50 to the ExpiredValue at a logOffset of 5
logOffset := Fixed64(5)
ev.Add(50, logOffset)
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions. This codebase contains several functions and types related to value expiration and rate control. Let's go through each of them:

The `ExpiredValue` type represents a value that expires over time. It has two fields: `Base`, which is the current value, and `Exp`, which is the expiration time in units of 2^64 per second. The `Value` method calculates the current value of the `ExpiredValue` at a given time, taking into account its expiration time. The `Add` method adds a signed value to the `ExpiredValue`, and returns the resulting value. The `AddExp` method adds another `ExpiredValue` to the current one, taking into account their respective expiration times.

The `LinearExpiredValue` type is similar to `ExpiredValue`, but its value expires linearly over time. It has three fields: `Offset`, which is the latest time offset in units of the expiration rate; `Val`, which is the remaining value, and can never be negative; and `Rate`, which is the expiration rate in nanoseconds. The `Value` method calculates the current value of the `LinearExpiredValue` at a given time, taking into account its expiration rate. The `Add` method adds a signed value to the `LinearExpiredValue` at a given time, taking into account its expiration rate.

The `ValueExpirer` interface defines methods for controlling value expiration rate. It has three methods: `SetRate`, which changes the expiration rate; `SetLogOffset`, which sets the logarithmic offset instantly; and `LogOffset`, which returns the current logarithmic offset.

The `Expirer` type implements the `ValueExpirer` interface. It has three fields: `logOffset`, which is the logarithmic offset; `rate`, which is the expiration rate; and `lastUpdate`, which is the last time the expiration rate was updated. The `SetRate` method changes the expiration rate, taking into account the time elapsed since the last update. The `SetLogOffset` method sets the logarithmic offset instantly. The `LogOffset` method returns the current logarithmic offset, taking into account the time elapsed since the last update.

Here's an example of how to use these functions and types:

```
// Create an Expirer with an initial logarithmic offset of 0 and an expiration rate of 1 second.
expirer := &Expirer{logOffset: 0, rate: 1e9, lastUpdate: mclock.Now()}

// Set the expiration rate to 2 seconds.
expirer.SetRate(mclock.Now(), 0.5e9)

// Add a value of 100 to an ExpiredValue with an expiration time of 1 second.
ev := &ExpiredValue{Base: 0, Exp: 1e18}
ev.Add(100, mclock.Now())

// Add an ExpiredValue with an expiration time of 2 seconds to another ExpiredValue with an expiration time of 1 second.
ev1 := &ExpiredValue{Base: 0, Exp: 1e18}
ev2 := &ExpiredValue{Base: 0, Exp: 2e18}
ev1.AddExp(*ev2)

// Calculate the value of a LinearExpiredValue with an initial value of 100, an expiration rate of 1 second, and a current time of 2 seconds.
lev := &LinearExpiredValue{Offset: 0, Val: 100, Rate: 1e9}
lev.Value(2e9)
``` # Fixed64 Documentation
