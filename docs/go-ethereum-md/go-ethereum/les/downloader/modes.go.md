The provided code is a Go package called `downloader` that defines a type `SyncMode` and some associated methods. The package also includes a license and import statement.

The `SyncMode` type is an unsigned 32-bit integer that represents the synchronization mode of the downloader. It has four possible values: `FullSync`, `FastSync`, `SnapSync`, and `LightSync`. These values are defined as constants using the `const` keyword.

The `IsValid()` method is a receiver function that takes a `SyncMode` value and returns a boolean indicating whether the value is a valid synchronization mode. It checks whether the value is between `FullSync` and `LightSync` (inclusive).

The `String()` method is another receiver function that takes a `SyncMode` value and returns a string representation of the value. It uses a switch statement to return the appropriate string for each possible value.

The `MarshalText()` method is a receiver function that takes a `SyncMode` value and returns a byte slice and an error. It converts the `SyncMode` value to a string and returns it as a byte slice. If the value is not a valid synchronization mode, it returns an error.

The `UnmarshalText()` method is a pointer receiver function that takes a byte slice and sets the `SyncMode` value to the corresponding synchronization mode. It uses a switch statement to check the string representation of the byte slice and sets the `SyncMode` value accordingly. If the string is not a valid synchronization mode, it returns an error.

Overall, this package provides a way to represent and manipulate synchronization modes for a downloader. The `SyncMode` type is used to ensure that only valid synchronization modes are used, and the associated methods provide ways to convert between `SyncMode` values and their string representations.
