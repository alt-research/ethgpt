These metrics are useful for monitoring the performance of the LES server and identifying any bottlenecks or issues that may arise. By measuring various aspects of the server's performance, developers can optimize the server for better efficiency and reliability. The code snippet provided is a part of a larger codebase that implements a metrics system for a peer-to-peer (p2p) network. The metrics system is used to collect and report various statistics related to the network's performance, such as the number of packets sent and received, the amount of traffic generated, and the time taken to process requests.

The code defines several metrics using the `metrics` package, which is a third-party library used for collecting and reporting metrics. The `metrics.NewRegistered...` functions are used to create new metrics and register them with the metrics system. The first argument to these functions is the name of the metric, and the second argument is a set of labels that can be used to group related metrics together.

The `meteredMsgReadWriter` struct is a wrapper around a `p2p.MsgReadWriter` object that adds metering support to the underlying data stream. The `ReadMsg` and `WriteMsg` methods of this struct are responsible for accounting for the data traffic and updating the relevant metrics.

The `newMeteredMsgWriter` function is a factory function that creates a new `meteredMsgReadWriter` object and returns it. If the metrics system is disabled, this function returns the original `p2p.MsgReadWriter` object without any metering support.

Here is an example of how to use the `metrics` package to create and register a new gauge metric:

```go
import "github.com/rcrowley/go-metrics"

// Create a new gauge metric
myGauge := metrics.NewGauge()

// Register the gauge metric with the metrics system
metrics.Register("myGauge", myGauge)
```

In this example, `myGauge` is a new gauge metric, and `metrics.Register` is used to register it with the metrics system under the name "myGauge". Once registered, the metric can be updated using the `myGauge.Update()` method, and its current value can be retrieved using the `myGauge.Value()` method.

Overall, the code provided is a good example of how to use the `metrics` package to collect and report various statistics related to a network's performance. By using this package, developers can easily add metering support to their code and gain valuable insights into how their network is performing.
