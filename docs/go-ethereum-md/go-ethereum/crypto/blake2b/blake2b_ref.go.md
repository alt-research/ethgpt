This codebase contains a single function `f` that is used in the Blake2b hash function implementation. Below is a brief description of the function:

`f(h *[8]uint64, m *[16]uint64, c0, c1 uint64, flag uint64, rounds uint64)`: This function takes pointers to two arrays of 64-bit unsigned integers `h` and `m`, two 64-bit unsigned integers `c0` and `c1`, a 64-bit unsigned integer `flag`, and a 64-bit unsigned integer `rounds`. It calls the `fGeneric` function with the same arguments. 

This function is only used when the build tag is not `amd64`, `appengine`, or `gccgo`. On those platforms, a different implementation of `f` is used.
