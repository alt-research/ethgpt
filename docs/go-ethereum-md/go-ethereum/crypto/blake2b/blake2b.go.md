The `blake2b` package implements the BLAKE2b hash algorithm defined by RFC 7693 and the extendable output function (XOF) BLAKE2Xb. The package provides functions to compute the BLAKE2b-512, BLAKE2b-384, and BLAKE2b-256 checksums of data, as well as functions to create new hash.Hash objects for custom hash sizes and keys.

`Sum512(data []byte) [Size]byte`: This function takes a byte slice `data` and returns a fixed-size array of bytes representing the BLAKE2b-512 checksum of the data.

`Sum384(data []byte) [Size384]byte`: This function takes a byte slice `data` and returns a fixed-size array of bytes representing the BLAKE2b-384 checksum of the data.

`Sum256(data []byte) [Size256]byte`: This function takes a byte slice `data` and returns a fixed-size array of bytes representing the BLAKE2b-256 checksum of the data.

`New512(key []byte) (hash.Hash, error)`: This function takes a byte slice `key` and returns a new hash.Hash object computing the BLAKE2b-512 checksum. If `key` is non-nil, the hash is turned into a MAC. The key must be between zero and 64 bytes long.

`New384(key []byte) (hash.Hash, error)`: This function takes a byte slice `key` and returns a new hash.Hash object computing the BLAKE2b-384 checksum. If `key` is non-nil, the hash is turned into a MAC. The key must be between zero and 64 bytes long.

`New256(key []byte) (hash.Hash, error)`: This function takes a byte slice `key` and returns a new hash.Hash object computing the BLAKE2b-256 checksum. If `key` is non-nil, the hash is turned into a MAC. The key must be between zero and 64 bytes long.

`New(size int, key []byte) (hash.Hash, error)`: This function takes an integer `size` and a byte slice `key` and returns a new hash.Hash object computing the BLAKE2b checksum with a custom length. If `key` is non-nil, the hash is turned into a MAC. The key must be between zero and 64 bytes long. The hash size can be a value between 1 and 64, but it is recommended to use values equal to or greater than 32 if BLAKE2b is used as a hash function and 16 if it is used as a MAC function. When the key is nil, the returned hash.Hash implements BinaryMarshaler and BinaryUnmarshaler for state (de)serialization as documented by hash.Hash.

`F(h *[8]uint64, m []byte, c uint64, f bool, rounds int)`: This function is a compression function for BLAKE2b. It takes as arguments the state vector `h`, message block vector `m`, offset counter `c`, final block indicator flag `f`, and number of rounds `rounds`. The state vector provided as the first parameter is modified by the function.

The package also defines constants for the block size and hash sizes of BLAKE2b, as well as error variables for invalid key and hash sizes. It also initializes an initialization vector `iv` used in the BLAKE2b algorithm. This codebase contains a set of functions that implement the BLAKE2b hash function. Below is a brief description of each function:

`F(h *[8]uint64, m [16]uint64, c [2]uint64, final bool, rounds uint32)`: This function takes pointers to an array of 8 64-bit unsigned integers `h`, an array of 16 64-bit unsigned integers `m`, an array of 2 64-bit unsigned integers `c`, a boolean `final`, and a 32-bit unsigned integer `rounds`. It calls the `f` function with the given parameters.

`newDigest(hashSize int, key []byte) (*digest, error)`: This function takes an integer `hashSize` and a byte slice `key`. It returns a pointer to a `digest` struct and an error. It checks that the `hashSize` is within the valid range and that the length of the `key` is not greater than the block size. It creates a new `digest` struct, sets its `size` and `keyLen` fields, copies the `key` into its `key` field, and calls its `Reset` method.

`checkSum(sum *[Size]byte, hashSize int, data []byte)`: This function takes a pointer to a byte array `sum`, an integer `hashSize`, and a byte slice `data`. It computes the BLAKE2b hash of the `data` and stores the result in the `sum` array.

`hashBlocks(h *[8]uint64, c *[2]uint64, flag uint64, blocks []byte)`: This function takes pointers to an array of 8 64-bit unsigned integers `h`, an array of 2 64-bit unsigned integers `c`, a 64-bit unsigned integer `flag`, and a byte slice `blocks`. It computes the BLAKE2b hash of the `blocks` and updates the `h` and `c` arrays.

`digest`: This is a struct that represents the state of the BLAKE2b hash function. It contains fields for the hash state `h`, the chaining values `c`, the hash size `size`, the current block `block`, the offset within the block `offset`, the key `key`, and the length of the key `keyLen`. It also contains methods for marshaling and unmarshaling the state, resetting the state, writing data to the state, and computing the final hash.

`MarshalBinary() ([]byte, error)`: This method marshals the state of the `digest` struct into a byte slice.

`UnmarshalBinary(b []byte) error`: This method unmarshals the state of the `digest` struct from a byte slice.

`BlockSize() int`: This method returns the block size of the BLAKE2b hash function.

`Size() int`: This method returns the hash size of the BLAKE2b hash function.

`Reset()`: This method resets the state of the `digest` struct.

`Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)`: This method writes data to the state of the `digest` struct.

`Sum(sum []byte) []byte`: This method computes the final hash of the `digest` struct and appends it to the given byte slice.

`finalize(hash *[Size]byte)`: This method finalizes the state of the `digest` struct and stores the result in the given byte array. This codebase contains a set of functions that deal with byte manipulation and hashing. Below is a brief description of each function:

`hashBlocks(h *[8]uint64, c *[2]uint64, flag uint64, d []byte)`: This function takes a pointer to an array of 8 64-bit unsigned integers `h`, a pointer to an array of 2 64-bit unsigned integers `c`, a 64-bit unsigned integer `flag`, and a byte slice `d`. It updates the `h` and `c` values by hashing the byte slice using the SHA-512 algorithm.

`hashFinal(h *[8]uint64, c *[2]uint64, flag uint64, out []byte)`: This function takes a pointer to an array of 8 64-bit unsigned integers `h`, a pointer to an array of 2 64-bit unsigned integers `c`, a 64-bit unsigned integer `flag`, and a byte slice `out`. It finalizes the hash by appending the remaining bytes, computing the length, and hashing the length and flag. It then writes the hash to the `out` byte slice.

`appendUint64(b []byte, x uint64) []byte`: This function takes a byte slice `b` and a 64-bit unsigned integer `x`. It appends the byte representation of `x` to the byte slice and returns the resulting byte slice.

`appendUint32(b []byte, x uint32) []byte`: This function takes a byte slice `b` and a 32-bit unsigned integer `x`. It appends the byte representation of `x` to the byte slice and returns the resulting byte slice. This function is currently unused and marked as dead code.

`consumeUint64(b []byte) ([]byte, uint64)`: This function takes a byte slice `b`. It reads the first 8 bytes of the byte slice as a 64-bit unsigned integer and returns the remaining byte slice and the integer.

`consumeUint32(b []byte) ([]byte, uint32)`: This function takes a byte slice `b`. It reads the first 4 bytes of the byte slice as a 32-bit unsigned integer and returns the remaining byte slice and the integer. This function is currently unused and marked as dead code.
