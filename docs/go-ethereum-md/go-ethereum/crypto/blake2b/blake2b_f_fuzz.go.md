This codebase contains a single function `Fuzz` that is used for fuzz testing the blake2b compression algorithm. Below is a brief description of the function:

`Fuzz(data []byte) int`: This function takes a byte slice `data` and returns an integer. It is used for fuzz testing the blake2b compression algorithm. It first checks that the length of the input data is 211 bytes. It then parses the input data into various variables including the number of rounds, the hash state, the message block, the message length, and the finalization flag. It then calls the blake2b compression algorithm using the generic implementation and the SSE4, AVX, and AVX2 instruction sets. It cross-references the results of each implementation with the generic implementation and panics if any mismatches are found. Finally, it returns 1 to indicate that the input data was valid.
