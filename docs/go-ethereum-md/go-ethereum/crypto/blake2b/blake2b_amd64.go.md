This codebase contains functions that implement the BLAKE2b hash function. Below is a brief description of each function:

`init()`: This function is called when the package is initialized. It sets the `useSSE4` variable to `true` if the CPU supports the SSE4.1 instruction set, which is used to accelerate the hash function.

`fSSE4(h *[8]uint64, m *[16]uint64, c0, c1 uint64, flag uint64, rounds uint64)`: This function is implemented in assembly and performs the core hash function operation using the SSE4.1 instruction set. It takes pointers to the hash state `h`, the message block `m`, constants `c0` and `c1`, a flag `flag`, and the number of rounds `rounds`.

`f(h *[8]uint64, m *[16]uint64, c0, c1 uint64, flag uint64, rounds uint64)`: This function is a wrapper around `fSSE4` and `fGeneric` and performs the core hash function operation. It takes pointers to the hash state `h`, the message block `m`, constants `c0` and `c1`, a flag `flag`, and the number of rounds `rounds`. If the `useSSE4` variable is `true`, it calls `fSSE4` with the same arguments, otherwise it calls `fGeneric`.

Note that the `//go:noescape` comment above `fSSE4` indicates that the function should not be inlined or otherwise modified by the Go compiler, as it is implemented in assembly.
