## Notes

This package is used in the implementation of the BLS12-381 elliptic curve in the Ethereum blockchain. This code snippet appears to be defining various constants and arrays of values used in elliptic curve cryptography. 

The `PointG1` and `PointG2` structs represent points on the elliptic curve, with `PointG1` being on the G1 group and `PointG2` being on the G2 group. Each point is defined by two `fe` or `fe2` structs, which represent the x and y coordinates of the point. 

The `fe` and `fe2` structs represent finite field elements, which are used in elliptic curve cryptography to perform arithmetic operations. 

The `frobeniusCoeffs61` and `frobeniusCoeffs62` arrays represent the Frobenius coefficients used in the Miller loop of pairing computation. 

Overall, this code appears to be defining the necessary constants and data structures for performing elliptic curve cryptography operations. Hello! I'd be happy to help you with documenting this codebase. From what I can see, this is a Go codebase that defines some constants for a cryptographic library. Specifically, it defines some finite field elements and Frobenius coefficients for a 12th-degree extension field. 

Here's a brief description of each function:

- `fe`: This function defines a finite field element. It takes in six 64-bit integers and returns a finite field element.
- `fe2`: This function defines a finite field element in a 2-dimensional array. It takes in two finite field elements and returns a 2-dimensional array of finite field elements.
- `zero`: This function returns a finite field element with all values set to 0.
- `one`: This function returns a finite field element with all values set to 1.
- `two`: This function returns a finite field element with all values set to 2.
- `negativeOne`: This function returns a finite field element with all values set to -1.
- `sqrt`: This function takes in a finite field element and returns the square root of that element.
- `mul`: This function takes in two finite field elements and returns their product.
- `square`: This function takes in a finite field element and returns its square.
- `add`: This function takes in two finite field elements and returns their sum.
- `sub`: This function takes in two finite field elements and returns their difference.
- `neg`: This function takes in a finite field element and returns its negation.
- `invert`: This function takes in a finite field element and returns its inverse.
- `pow2k`: This function takes in a finite field element and an integer k, and returns the element raised to the power of 2^k.
- `frobeniusMap`: This function takes in a finite field element and an integer i, and returns the i-th Frobenius map of that element.
- `frobenius`: This function takes in a 2-dimensional array of finite field elements and an integer i, and applies the i-th Frobenius map to each element in the array.

Here's an example of how `fe` is used in the code:

```
fe{0x760900000002fffd, 0xebf4000bc40c0002, 0x5f48985753c758ba, 0x77ce585370525745, 0x5c071a97a256ec6d, 0x15f65ec3fa80e493}
```

This creates a finite field element with the values `0x760900000002fffd`, `0xebf4000bc40c0002`, `0x5f48985753c758ba`, `0x77ce585370525745`, `0x5c071a97a256ec6d`, and `0x15f65ec3fa80e493`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can do to assist you. # Source Code Documentation

This source code defines a constant and a variable.

## Constant

### edwardsD

```go
const edwardsD = -39081
```

edwardsD is a constant of type int that represents the value of the parameter `d` in the Edwards curve equation: `x^2 + y^2 = 1 + d*x^2*y^2`. This constant is used in the implementation of the Edwards curve arithmetic.

## Variable

### x

```go
var x = bigFromHex("0xd201000000010000")
```

x is a variable of type `*big.Int` that represents a big integer value. It is initialized with the value `0xd201000000010000` in hexadecimal format. This variable is used in the implementation of the Edwards curve arithmetic.
