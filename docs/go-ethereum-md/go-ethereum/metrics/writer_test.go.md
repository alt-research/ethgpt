Certainly, I can help you with that! Here's an example of how you could document the code you provided in Markdown format:

## Metrics Package

The `metrics` package provides functionality for working with metrics.

### Functions

#### `TestMetricsSorting(t *testing.T)`

This function is used to test the sorting of named metrics. It takes one parameter:

- `t` (*testing.T): The testing object.

### Types

#### `namedMetricSlice`

This type is a slice of named metrics that can be sorted.

##### Fields

- `name` (string): The name of the metric.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you could use the `metrics` package in your Go code:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sort"

    "github.com/example/metrics"
)

func main() {
    // Create a slice of named metrics
    var namedMetrics = metrics.NamedMetricSlice{
        {Name: "zzz"},
        {Name: "bbb"},
        {Name: "fff"},
        {Name: "ggg"},
    }

    // Sort the named metrics
    sort.Sort(namedMetrics)

    // Print the sorted named metrics
    for _, namedMetric := range namedMetrics {
        fmt.Println(namedMetric.Name)
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a slice of named metrics and sort them using the `sort.Sort` function provided by the `metrics` package. We then print the sorted named metrics to the console.
