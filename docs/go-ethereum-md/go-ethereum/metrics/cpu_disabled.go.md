Certainly, I can help you with that! Here's an example of how you could document the code you provided in Markdown format:

## Metrics Package

The `metrics` package provides functionality for retrieving and reporting metrics related to the Ethereum blockchain.

### ReadCPUStats Function

#### `ReadCPUStats(stats *CPUStats)`

This function retrieves the current CPU stats. Internally, it uses `gosigar`, which is not supported on the platforms in this file.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you could use the `ReadCPUStats` function in your Go code:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/metrics"
)

func main() {
    stats := &metrics.CPUStats{}
    metrics.ReadCPUStats(stats)
    fmt.Println("CPU stats:", stats)
}
```

In this example, we import the `metrics` package and use the `ReadCPUStats` function to retrieve the current CPU stats. We then print the stats to the console. However, since `ReadCPUStats` is not supported on the platforms in this file, this code will not work as expected.
