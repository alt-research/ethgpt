Certainly, I can help you with that! Here's an example of how you could document the code you provided in Markdown format:

## Healthcheck Interface

The `Healthcheck` interface defines several functions that can be used to check the health status of a system.

### Functions

#### `Check()`

This function is used to check the health status of a system.

#### `Error() error`

This function is used to get the error status of a system.

#### `Healthy()`

This function is used to mark a system as healthy.

#### `Unhealthy(error)`

This function is used to mark a system as unhealthy and store the error.

### NewHealthcheck Function

The `NewHealthcheck` function is used to construct a new `Healthcheck` object.

#### `NewHealthcheck(f func(Healthcheck)) Healthcheck`

This function takes a function as a parameter and returns a new `Healthcheck` object that will use the given function to update its status.

### NilHealthcheck Type

The `NilHealthcheck` type is a no-op implementation of the `Healthcheck` interface.

#### `Check()`

This function is a no-op.

#### `Error() error`

This function returns `nil`.

#### `Healthy()`

This function is a no-op.

#### `Unhealthy(error)`

This function is a no-op.

### StandardHealthcheck Type

The `StandardHealthcheck` type is the standard implementation of a `Healthcheck` and stores the status and a function to call to update the status.

#### `Check()`

This function runs the healthcheck function to update the healthcheck's status.

#### `Error() error`

This function returns the healthcheck's status, which will be `nil` if it is healthy.

#### `Healthy()`

This function marks the healthcheck as healthy.

#### `Unhealthy(error)`

This function marks the healthcheck as unhealthy. The error is stored and may be retrieved by the `Error` method.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you could use the `Healthcheck` interface in your Go code:

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/example/metrics"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new healthcheck
    healthcheck := metrics.NewHealthcheck(func(h metrics.Healthcheck) {
        // Check the health status of the system
        if systemIsHealthy() {
            h.Healthy()
        } else {
            h.Unhealthy(fmt.Errorf("system is unhealthy"))
        }
    })

    // Check the health status of the system
    healthcheck.Check()

    // Get the error status of the system
    err := healthcheck.Error()
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("System is healthy")
    }
}

func systemIsHealthy() bool {
    // Check the health status of the system
    // ...
}
```

In this example, we create a new `Healthcheck` object using the `NewHealthcheck` function and a function that checks the health status of the system. We then check the health status of the system using the `Check` method and get the error status of the system using the `Error` method. If the system is healthy, we print a message indicating that the system is healthy. If the system is unhealthy, we print the error message.
