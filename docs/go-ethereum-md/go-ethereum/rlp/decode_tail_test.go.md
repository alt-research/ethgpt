# RLP Package

The RLP package is a Go implementation of the Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) encoding and decoding algorithm. RLP is a serialization format used by the Ethereum blockchain to encode and decode data.

## structWithTail

The `structWithTail` type is a struct that contains three fields: `A`, `B`, and `C`. The `C` field is a slice of unsigned integers that is tagged with the `tail` struct tag. The `tail` tag is used to decode lists of differing length into a struct.

## ExampleDecode_structTagTail

The `ExampleDecode_structTagTail` function is an example of how to use the `tail` struct tag to decode lists of differing length into a struct. The function creates a `structWithTail` instance and decodes RLP-encoded data into it using the `Decode` function. The function then prints the decoded value and any errors that occurred during decoding.

## Decode

The `Decode` function decodes RLP-encoded data into a Go value. The function takes an `io.Reader` and a pointer to a Go value as arguments. The function returns an error if decoding fails.

## bytes.NewReader

The `bytes.NewReader` function creates a new `io.Reader` that reads from a byte slice.

## fmt.Printf

The `fmt.Printf` function formats and prints values to standard output. The function takes a format string and a variable number of arguments as arguments.

## Output

The `Output` comment is a special comment that is used by the `go doc` tool to generate documentation examples. The comment is used to show the expected output of the `ExampleDecode_structTagTail` function.
