# RLP Encoder

This package provides an implementation of the Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) encoding algorithm. RLP is a serialization format used by Ethereum to encode data structures for storage on the blockchain.

## MyCoolType

`MyCoolType` is a custom data type that represents a name and two unsigned integers. It is used to demonstrate how to encode data using RLP.

## EncodeRLP

`EncodeRLP` is a method of `MyCoolType` that encodes the data as an RLP list of the two unsigned integers, omitting the `Name` field.

## ExampleEncoder

`ExampleEncoder` is a function that demonstrates how to use the RLP encoder. It creates a `MyCoolType` instance with a `Name` field and two unsigned integers, encodes it using RLP, and prints the resulting bytes in hexadecimal format.

The first example shows how to encode a `nil` pointer to `MyCoolType`. The resulting RLP encoding is `C0`.

The second example shows how to encode a `MyCoolType` instance with a `Name` field and two unsigned integers. The resulting RLP encoding is `C20506`.

## Usage

To use the RLP encoder, import the `github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/rlp` package. Call the `Encode` or `EncodeToBytes` function to encode a data structure. The resulting bytes can be stored on the blockchain or transmitted over the network.

```go
import "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/rlp"

type MyData struct {
    Field1 string
    Field2 uint
}

data := &MyData{"hello", 42}
bytes, err := rlp.EncodeToBytes(data)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```
