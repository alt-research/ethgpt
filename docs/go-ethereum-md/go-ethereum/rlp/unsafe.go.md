# RLP Package

The RLP package is a Go implementation of the Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) encoding and decoding algorithm. This package provides functions for encoding and decoding data structures using the RLP algorithm.

## byteArrayBytes

```go
func byteArrayBytes(v reflect.Value, length int) []byte
```

The `byteArrayBytes` function takes a `reflect.Value` and a `length` integer as input parameters and returns a slice of bytes. This function is used to extract a slice of bytes from a byte array.

## Build Tags

```go
//go:build !nacl && !js && cgo
// +build !nacl,!js,cgo
```

The build tags are used to specify the build constraints for the package. In this case, the package is only built if the `nacl`, `js`, and `cgo` build tags are not present.
