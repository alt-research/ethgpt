# Switching between networks

When a user selects the RabbitHole option and MetaMask is connected, upon clicking the “Confirm Swap“ button, a pop-up appears with instructions on how to switch between networks. A switch is only possible from MetaMask, but not from the dApp.

## Steps that users have to complete to change the network to RabbitHole:

* Open MetaMask in the browser panel;
* Click the account and choose “Settings“ from the drop-down menu;
* Select the “Network“ option;
* Click the “Add Network“ button;
* Use following parameters:
    + Network name: RabbitHole
    + New RPC URL: https://rabbithole.1inch.io/1
    + Chain ID: 1
    + Currency symbol: ETH
    + Block explorer URL: https://etherscan.io
