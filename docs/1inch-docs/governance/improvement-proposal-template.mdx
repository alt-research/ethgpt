# 1inch Improvement Proposal (1IP) Template

## Title
Title should reflect the content of the 1IP. 

 For the forum post, prefix “[1RC]” to the title and set the tag on the post to `phase-2`. Proposals will be assigned an 1IP-# at the time of Phase 4 Snapshot creation.

## Simple Summary
A brief, high-level summary of what changes are being suggested. Summary should be a single sentence, or a bulleted list.

## Abstract
Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the motivation and specification sections. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

## Motivation
The motivation section should describe the "why" of this 1IP. What problem does it solve? Why should someone want to implement this standard? What benefit does it provide to the 1inch Network or protocols? What use cases does this 1IP address?

## Specification 
The specification section should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, or change, at a technical level. The specification should be detailed enough to allow for implementation by a development team.

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered, and explain why the proposed specification provides the most amount of net benefit.

## Considerations
All 1IPs must contain a section that discusses the security and governance implications/considerations of the proposal.

Security specific implications/considerations include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, drawbacks, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed, etc.

Governance specific implications/considerations include impact on revenue stream, cost to treasury, voting process, staking, tokenomics, etc.

If the proposal requires payment to a third party team, this section must contain the qualifications of said team.
