A comprehensive list of common DeFi terms and phrases

As you begin (or continue) your journey through Decentralized Finance (DeFi), you will notice that there is no shortage of new terminology.

**Here are some terms you may encounter:**

**Airdrop:** A distribution of tokens to various users of a network, often with the sole intent of on-boarding and/or providing existing users with value or governance voting rights.

**Anti-money Laundering (AML):** A set of practices or policies that centralized entities use to comply with local and federal laws and regulations. These procedures are designed to identify, report, and prevent illicit financial activity.

**Annual Percentage Yield (APY):** The compounded annual rate of return on capital locked within a protocol. (i.e. liquidity pools or 1inch liquidity mining program)

The APY for 1inch liquidity pools can be calculated by the formula:

_(current_liquidity/(current_liquidity - profit_last_24_hours))^365_

**[Approval:](https://help.1inch.io/en/?q=approval)** The act of giving permission to the 1inch smart contract to spend your assets. The miners of the network are compensated with a gas fee (paid by you) to record this action on the blockchain.

**Arbitrage:** The act of buying the same asset in one market to sell in another, with the goal of profiting from the price difference of both markets.

**Automated Market Maker (AMM)**: A decentralized pricing mechanism that uses mathematical formulas (most commonly x*y=k) to regulate the supply of assets within a liquidity pool.

**[Binance Smart Chain (BEP20)](https://help.1inch.io/en/articles/4966690-how-to-use-1inch-on-bsc-binance-smart-chain)**: An independent blockchain built by Binance that is designed to be faster, gas efficient, and compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. BEP20 is the standard that binds all tokens on the Binance Smart Chain to the same rules when interacting with each other and smart contracts.

**Block Explorer:** A tool for searching and exploring all publicly available information on a particular blockchain.

**Block Reward:**

Newly minted tokens or coins that are distributed to a miner/validator in exchange for verifying transactions within a block (on a blockchain). Block rewards are implemented within all mainstream consensus mechanisms.

**Bridge:** A decentralized connection protocol that allows tokens with the same contract addresses on different blockchains to be converted from one network to another.

CHI is available on both Ethereum and BNB Chain, and is pegged to the Ethereum and BNB Chain network’s gas price respectively. ***Please note: Due to the EIP1559 hard fork, CHI no longer works as a gas token.

Coinbase: The first transaction in a block. It is a new unspent transaction output (UTXO) containing the miner's reward for mining (or validating) the following transaction within the same block.

**Cold Wallet:** A digital asset wallet that is maintained offline. Also known as "Cold Storage" this method can consist of storing the private key on physical paper (paper wallet) on a secure hardware device (such as a[ Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) or[ Trezor](https://trezor.io/)), or even through memorization of the key or recovery phrase!

**Consensus:** The moment that is achieved when all nodes on a network come to agreement in about the verification and order of transactions within a block.

**Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO):** A decentralized system of governance that enables 1INCH stakers and community members to vote for key protocol parameters and assume responsibility for network implementation.

**Decentralized Application dApp:** A computer application that runs on top of a distributed network, providing an interface for users to interact with blockchains and associated smart contracts.

**Decentralized Exchange (DEX):** A blockchain-based, peer-to-peer trading platform that allows users to exchange value with each other in an open, permissionless environment.

**Derivative: **A derivative is a secondary asset who's value is derived from a primary asset or basket of assets. In DeFi this can refer to synthetic futures, options, prediction markets etc.

**Dex Aggregator:** A decentralized network protocol that gives users access to liquidity across many DEXes, all in one simple interface. Through efficient routing, a DEX aggregator can effectively reduce slippage, swap fees, and token prices for users.

**Ethereum (ERC20):** Ethereum is an open-source, smart contract compatible blockchain designed by Vitalik Buterin. ERC20 is the standard that binds all tokens on Ethereum to the same rules when interacting with each other and smart contracts.

While some people speculate on governance token values and trade them on open markets, these tokens have no utility aside from legislation and voting rights.

**Hardware Wallet:** A piece of secure hardware that is capable of storing digital assets and can be completely disconnected from the internet. Hardware wallets are considered to be one of the most secure methods for storing assets.

**Liquidity Provider (LP):** A token holder who provides liquidity (in equal amounts of a pair of tokens) to a pool, with the intention of receiving a portion of trading fees as a reward.

**Liquidity Source:** A source of liquidity for a swap, these can include native liquidity pools, decentralized exchanges, centralized financial institutions, and private market makers.

**LP Tokens:** Also known as “Liquidity Provider Tokens”, these tokens are minted and distributed to a liquidity provider as a “placeholder” for their liquidity. To help offset impermanent loss, LP tokens can be used to generate additional rewards in various liquidity mining programs.

**Market Order:** An order to buy or sell tokens at the current market price.

**Maximal Extractable Value (MEV):** Previously known as “Miner Extractable Value”, this term represents the activity of blockchain validators manipulating transactions within a block to extract maximum value from a sender/receiver.

If a trade was routed through other protocols (Liquidity Sources), referrers may also receive a part of the spread surplus if available.

**Rug Pull:** A very common scam tactic, where an initial liquidity provider (or token creator) suddenly withdraws a majority of their liquidity from the pool, effectively stealing funds from speculators who bought the now worthless token.

**Sandwich attack:** A variation of front-running, where an attacker sees a sizable transaction waiting in the mempool, then places a significantly larger transaction (with the same tokens) directly before and after the victim’s transaction. This drives the rate of the victim’s transaction up, effectively allowing the front runner to extract the difference in value.

These rewards act as an incentive to liquidity providers to keep their liquidity in the pool by minimizing the impact of impermanent loss and leveraging their existing capital.
