# Introduction

The 1inch API v5, Pathfinder, is a cutting-edge discovery and routing algorithm, which offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market. Pathfinder finds the most efficient paths for a token swap, able to split between different protocols and even different market depths in within one protocol in the shortest possible time.

This API documentation is intended for public use. **If you are an enterprise with significant trading volumes please fill in the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdU7Ahn3YmbssoQiTbs0Fk0TB_7al9O_4ZQIUiZp3OxYzfWtg/viewform)** so we can assign you a custom API endpoint.
