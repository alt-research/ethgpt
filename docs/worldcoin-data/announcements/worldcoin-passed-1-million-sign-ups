This is an important milestone in our mission to provide universal access to the global economy. It was achieved with a limited number of Orbs and Worldcoin Operators, demonstrating a clear path towards reaching our goal as we scale our operations in 2023. The first million sign-ups came from individuals in diverse countries including Argentina, Chile, India, Kenya, Portugal, Spain and Uganda. In cities like Nairobi and Lisbon, where total sign-ups have exceeded 360K, Worldcoin has become one of the most downloaded finance apps ahead of the mainnet launch. According to the McKinsey Global Institute’s report Digital identification: A key to inclusive growth, there are over 4.4 billion people worldwide who either don’t have a legal identity or have one that can’t be digitally verified. This is a major stumbling block when it comes to accessing financial services. We believe that Worldcoin, through World ID’s privacy-preserving digital identity, has an essential role to play in solving this and other fundamental global challenges. What’s next We’re looking forward to announcing more significant milestones in the near term. Among these are the scaled-up distribution of Orbs, manufactured in Germany, to more local Worldcoin Operators in cities around the world. We will also be open sourcing more of the Orb’s hardware to increase public transparency and releasing the World ID software development kit (SDK) to unlock the full utility of the Worldcoin protocol. The mainnet launch of the Worldcoin Token is expected to take place in the first half of 2023. Thank you to the global Worldcoin Operators whose dedication and hard work have made it possible to achieve this milestone and to the more than one million people who are now participating in the protocol.

This is an important milestone in our mission to provide universal access to the global economy. It was achieved with a limited number of Orbs and Worldcoin Operators, demonstrating a clear path towards reaching our goal as we scale our operations in 2023. The first million sign-ups came from individuals in diverse countries including Argentina, Chile, India, Kenya, Portugal, Spain and Uganda. In cities like Nairobi and Lisbon, where total sign-ups have exceeded 360K, Worldcoin has become one of the most downloaded finance apps ahead of the mainnet launch. According to the McKinsey Global Institute’s report Digital identification: A key to inclusive growth, there are over 4.4 billion people worldwide who either don’t have a legal identity or have one that can’t be digitally verified. This is a major stumbling block when it comes to accessing financial services. We believe that Worldcoin, through World ID’s privacy-preserving digital identity, has an essential role to play in solving this and other fundamental global challenges. What’s next We’re looking forward to announcing more significant milestones in the near term. Among these are the scaled-up distribution of Orbs, manufactured in Germany, to more local Worldcoin Operators in cities around the world. We will also be open sourcing more of the Orb’s hardware to increase public transparency and releasing the World ID software development kit (SDK) to unlock the full utility of the Worldcoin protocol.
