## Edit an existing page

To edit an existing page in the documentation, create a fork of the repo, commit your edits and submit a PR.

- Go to the page in the docs
- Click “Edit this page” at the bottom of the page
- Edit the page directly on GitHub
- Describe the edit in the commit
- Select “Create a new branch and start a pull request”
- Describe changes in the Pull Request (PR)
- Select “critesjosh” as a reviewer
- Changes must be approved and pass all of the site build checks before being merged.

## Add/remove pages

To add a new page to the documentation, create a fork, add the new pages and update the table of contents file to include your new pages in the appropriate location and submit a PR.

- Add or delete pages directly in Github
- Put new pages where you think makes the most sense, we can move them later
- Create a PR to have your changes added to the live version of the site
- Update the file called “sidebars.js” in the main folder
- This file contains the site layout that you see on the left side of the docs site
- Add or remove the appropriate files from the list
