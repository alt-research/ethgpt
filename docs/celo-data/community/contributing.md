# Celo Community

Join a community of developers, designers, dreamers, and doers building prosperity for everyone.

Celo is a decentralized community of creators -- developers, designers, dreamers, doers -- who are motivated by the power of accessible financial tools to make the world a better place. We are guided by [Celo's Core tenets](https://celo.org/community).
