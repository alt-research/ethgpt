As the blockchain industry continues to evolve and grow, it's more important than ever for developers to stay ahead of the curve and gain the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the web3 ecosystem. That's why we're excited to announce the launch of the Celo StackShift program, an initiative aimed at providing resources and support for developers, builders, and creators in the web3 ecosystem.

In the medium to long term, the first cohort of the StackShift program will be a part of a talent pool for companies seeking to build with Celo and have the support to establish their own companies.
