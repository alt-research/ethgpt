# Using a Ledger with MetaMask

Things to keep in mind when using a Ledger hardware wallet with MetaMask to connect to the Celo network.

---

## Using the Ledger

- When using MetaMask with a Ledger, users should open the Ethereum app on their Ledger hardware device, not the Celo app.
- Users using a Celo-specific wallet with the Ledger should still use the Celo app.

## Recovering Assets

- When recovering [Celo sent to an Eth address](holder/recover/from-eth-address), use Metamask with the Ethereum app on the Ledger device.
- When recovering [Eth sent to a Celo address](holder/recover/from-celo-address), use the Celo app on the Ledger device with any Celo wallet.
