# Celo Protocol

Summary of the Celo Payments Protocol and the value it provides to the community.
[Read the specification.](https://github.com/celo-org/payments/blob/main/README.md)

## The Platform for Mobile Payments

The Celo blockchain has a transaction finality of less than five seconds with less than $0.001 fees, it is fully decentralized and it's a carbon negative blockchain to preserve our most precious resources.

## Stable Value Currencies

Powered by a platform algorithmic native stable coins, Celo Dollars (cUSD), Celo Euros (cEUR) and Celo Reals (cREAL) are ideal for making payments on your local currency through your mobile phone number. These stablecoins can be used for our merchant payments API and developers can choose which ones they want to expose for their users.

## Supporting Wallets

- Valora [iOS](https://vlra.app/webappstore) [Android](https://vlra.app/webplaystore))

### Coming Soon

- Node Wallet [BETA iOS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/BHXMFq0x) [Android Wailist](https://www.nodewallet.xyz/android)

## Requirements

This is the exhaustive list of requirements to run this repository

- `node 12`
- `yarn`
- A `CELO` private key for development purposes.
- A `DEK` for development purposes.

### Project Structure

The following is a short description of each of the package directories:

`packages/cli` - CLI code and scripts that demonstrate the SDK capabilities

`packages/sdk` - the actual SDK implementation code

`packages/server` - an example/reference code that demonstrate how a typical server might use the SDK

`packages/types` - protocol compliant schemas and types

#### Regarding the CELO private key

For one-off uses, simply use `celocli account:new`. To get the CELO CLI, follow the instructions here: https://docs.celo.org/cli.

To make things a bit simpler, I recommend running that command to create a .env file for testing:

```
# Make sure you're working on alfajores network
celocli config:set --node https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org/

If this is the first time you're running this command, the script will create a blockchain account/private-key for you and ask you to fund it using Celo faucet. Then this account will be used automatically to pay for the requested payment.

# Create an account and store it well formatted in an .env file
celocli account:new | sed -E 's/: (.+)/="\1"/g' | grep '=' > .env
source .env

# Copy the account address to your clipboard
echo $accountAddress | pbcopy

# Head to the faucet to get some money and paste your account address there
open https://faucet.celo.org

# Verify you got money successfully
celocli account:balance $accountAddress

# Register your account
celocli account:register --from $accountAddress -k $privateKey
```

#### Regarding the DEK

For the server to know about your DEK, your account created above _needs_ to be [registered](https://docs.celo.org/command-line-interface/account#celocli-accountregister) and have the public key of your DEK [registered too](https://docs.celo.org/command-line-interface/account#celocli-accountregister-data-encryption-key).

##### Why do you need a DEK?

First, some context: the payment SDK is meant to be used within Valora initially, and they already handle creating keys and accounts under the hood for the user. However, it's important to understand why you need to sign with a different key than the root key of your account. Generally we want a separation of concerns when dealing with private keys, they should do one thing and one thing only. Your account key, as it can move funds, is like the keys to the castle and should be kept as cold as possible. Your DEK, vote signing key, etc are less sensitive a

In order to do that, this command may be useful:

```
# Register a public data encryption key
celocli account:register-data-encryption-key --from $accountAddress -k privateKey --publicKey <DEK_PUBLIC_KEY>
```

## How to run each package

The payments monorepo is composed of a couple packages. But only 2 are meant to be used from the outside: the CLI and the development server. The other packages (sdk, types, and utils) are used by the CLI and server respectively.

First, run `yarn && yarn lerna bootstrap` to install the dependencies and bootstrap the monorepo.

### The payments API reference server

You can run `yarn start` to run the server with hot-reloading enabled. It will run by default on port 3000, useful for the next section.

### The payments CLI

Run the payment CLI in interactive mode `yarn cli init -p <PRIVATE_KEY> -d <DEK> -u http://localhost:3000 -r SIMPLE` from the root of the repository. You can also see the full list of available flags via `yarn cli init --help` and all available commands via `yarn cli help`.
You may also omit all the flags to run the command interactively.

The reference servers implements two types of payments: KYC and SIMPLE, you try both via the `-r` flag. If you decide to implement a new purchase example, you can find them in the folder `packages/server/src/storage/items`.

## Accepting Payments

This is the main export that wallets will want to integrate with. It allows you to get the payment info and subsequently make the payment transaction.

Example run through of Charge usage

Here is the api url that the Charge instance will be communicating with.

```typescript
const apiBase = "merchantpayments.com/api";
```

The id of the payment request used by the api. The api will need to create a payment object for the SDK to respond to. This will need to have the info in the PaymentInfo type and the referenceId will refer to this object.

```typescript
const referenceId = "123abc";
```

The 'ChainHandler' instance imported from the payments-sdk and initialized with a contract kit instance. This kit will represent the Payer in the process.

```typescript
const chainHandler = new ContractKitTransactionHandler(kit);
```

Whether or not a DEK should be used for authorizing on chain transactions.

```typescript
const useAuthentication = true;
```

How many times requests should be retried.

```typescript
const retries = 4;

const charge = new Charge(
  apiBase,
  referenceId,
  chainHandler,
  useAuthentication,
  retries
);
```

The info regarding the payment matching the reference id coming from the api. See @celo/payment-types PaymentInfo. Includes the requiredPayerData field that must be used for the submit method. Also, includes payment meta data to show to the user.

```typescript
const paymentInfo: PaymentInfo = await charge.getInfo();
```

### Examples

How much you want to set as the payment:

```typescript
console.log(paymentInfo.action.amount);
```

Specifying the token you want to use

```typescript
console.log(paymentInfo.action.currency);
```

Merchants might require some KYC data on who is paying for the transaction. This will be passed into the submit method.

```typescript
const payerDataExample = {
  phoneNumber: '12345678',
};

try {
```

This is the method to submit the transaction on chain

```typescript
  await charge.submit(payerDataExample);
} catch(e) {

```

If for some reason the transaction fails to submit the promise returned by submit will be rejected.
The charge can be aborted to let the api know not to continue watching for the transaction. See @celo/payment-types AbortCodes for abort code options.

```typescript
charge.abort(AbortCodes.INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS);
```

Reaching here would mean the payment was successfully submitted on chain.

```typescript
console.log("Payment submitted");
```

## ChainHandlers

Wrappers to help the PaymentsSDK interact with the blockchain.

### ContractKitTransactionHandler

Used to wrap ContractKit to make a ChainHandler for the Charge class

## Helpers

A variety of helper methods to facilitate payments-sdk interactions
