## Multi-Asset

Celo is turning crypto into usable money with a multi-asset system: a utility, governance, and staking asset (CELO) and a growing family of Mento stablecoins named for the currencies they algorithmically follow (e.g., cUSD, cEUR, cREAL).

## EVM-Compatible

An EVM-compatible solution capable of reaching billions of global users at scale, Celo’s technology supports 1000+ projects from builders, developers, and even artists who everyday launch new applications and issue digital currencies from everywhere in the world usable by anyone in the world with a desktop computer or mobile phone.
