# Go Ethereum Library - Node Package

This package contains the implementation of the Ethereum node. It provides the functionality to create, configure, and run an Ethereum node.

## Functions

### TestDatadirCreation

This function tests the creation of data directories. It creates a temporary data directory and checks that it can be used by a node. It also generates a long non-existing data directory path and checks that it gets created by a node. Finally, it verifies that an impossible data directory fails creation.

### TestIPCPathResolution

This function tests the resolution of IPC paths to valid endpoints of different platforms. It provides a set of test cases with different data directory and IPC path configurations and checks that the IPC endpoint is correctly resolved.

### TestNodeKeyPersistency

This function tests the persistency of node keys. It creates a temporary folder and ensures that no key is present. It configures a node with a preset key and ensures that it's not persisted. It then generates a new key and ensures that it's persisted. Finally, it loads the persisted key and ensures that it matches the generated key.

This code block generates and persists node keys for Ethereum nodes. It is used in the Ethereum build system to configure nodes for testing and deployment.

## Functions

### `NodeKey()`

This function generates and persists a node key for an Ethereum node. It takes no parameters and returns no values. It first generates a one-shot node key using the `crypto.GenerateKey()` function. If the key generation fails, the function returns an error. Otherwise, it creates a `Config` object with the name of the node, the data directory, and the private key. If the private key file already exists in the data directory, the function fails with an error. Otherwise, it persists the private key to the file and returns.

### `TestNodeKeyPersistence()`

This function tests the persistence of node keys for Ethereum nodes. It takes a testing object as a parameter and returns no values. It first generates and persists a one-shot node key using the `NodeKey()` function. It then creates a new `Config` object with the same name and data directory, but no preset private key. It calls the `NodeKey()` function again and checks that the private key file exists in the data directory. If it does not exist, the function fails with an error. Otherwise, it loads the private key from the file and checks that it matches the previously generated key. Finally, it creates a new `Config` object with an ephemeral data directory and calls the `NodeKey()` function again. It checks that the private key file is not persisted to disk. If it is, the function fails with an error.

## Variables

### `datadirPrivateKey`

This variable is a string constant that specifies the name of the private key file in the data directory. It is used in the `NodeKey()` function to persist the private key to the file and in the `TestNodeKeyPersistence()` function to check that the file exists.
