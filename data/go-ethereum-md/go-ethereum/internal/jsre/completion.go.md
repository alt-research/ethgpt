This is a Go package that provides a JavaScript runtime environment (JSRE) for executing JavaScript code within a Go program. The package is named `jsre` and is located in the `github.com/dop251/goja` repository.

The package contains a struct named `JSRE` that has a method named `CompleteKeywords`. This method takes a string argument `line` and returns a slice of strings that represent potential continuations for the given line. The method uses the `getCompletions` function to evaluate the line and retrieve the completions.

The `getCompletions` function takes a `goja.Runtime` object and a string argument `line`. The function splits the line into parts and finds the right-most fully named object in the line. It then goes over the keys of the object and retains the keys matching the prefix. Finally, the function appends an opening parenthesis (for functions) or dot (for objects) if the line itself is the only completion.

The `numerical` variable is a regular expression that matches a JavaScript numerical token.

The package also contains a license header that specifies the terms under which the package is distributed.
