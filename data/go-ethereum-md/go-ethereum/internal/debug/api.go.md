The `debug` package provides an interface to Go runtime debugging facilities. It defines a `HandlerT` type that implements the debugging API and a `Handler` variable that is the global debugging handler.

The `HandlerT` type has several methods that provide access to runtime debugging facilities. The `Verbosity` method sets the log verbosity ceiling. The `Vmodule` method sets the log verbosity pattern. The `BacktraceAt` method sets the log backtrace location. The `MemStats` method returns detailed runtime memory statistics. The `GcStats` method returns GC statistics. The `CpuProfile` method turns on CPU profiling for a specified number of seconds and writes profile data to a file. The `StartCPUProfile` method turns on CPU profiling and writes to the given file. The `StopCPUProfile` method stops an ongoing CPU profile. The `GoTrace` method turns on tracing for a specified number of seconds and writes trace data to a file. The `StartGoTrace` method turns on tracing and writes to the given file. The `StopGoTrace` method stops an ongoing trace.

The `Handler` variable is the global debugging handler. It is an instance of `HandlerT`.

The `expandHome` function expands the tilde character in a file path to the home directory of the current user.

The `init` function initializes the logger for the `debug` package.

The `glogger` variable is the logger for the `debug` package.

The `cpuProfileRE` variable is a regular expression that matches CPU profile file names.

The `goTraceRE` variable is a regular expression that matches Go trace file names.

The `cpuProfileDuration` variable is the default duration for CPU profiling.

The `goTraceDuration` variable is the default duration for Go tracing.

The `cpuProfileUsage` variable is the usage string for the `cpuProfile` command.

The `goTraceUsage` variable is the usage string for the `goTrace` command.

The `cpuProfileCmd` function is the implementation of the `cpuProfile` command. It turns on CPU profiling for a specified number of seconds and writes profile data to a file.

The `goTraceCmd` function is the implementation of the `goTrace` command. It turns on tracing for a specified number of seconds and writes trace data to a file.

The `NewHandler` function creates a new `HandlerT` instance.

The `StartCPUProfile` function turns on CPU profiling and writes to the given file.

The `StopCPUProfile` function stops an ongoing CPU profile.

The `StartGoTrace` function turns on tracing and writes to the given file.

The `StopGoTrace` function stops an ongoing trace. The `HandlerT` type provides methods for profiling and debugging the Go Ethereum client.

The `GoTrace` method starts a Go trace and writes the trace data to the provided file for the specified number of seconds. It sleeps for the specified number of seconds and then stops the trace.

The `BlockProfile` method turns on goroutine profiling for the specified number of seconds and writes the profile data to the provided file. It uses a profile rate of 1 for most accurate information. If a different rate is desired, set the rate and write the profile manually.

The `SetBlockProfileRate` method sets the rate of goroutine block profile data collection. A rate of 0 disables block profiling.

The `WriteBlockProfile` method writes a goroutine blocking profile to the given file.

The `MutexProfile` method turns on mutex profiling for the specified number of seconds and writes the profile data to the provided file. It uses a profile rate of 1 for most accurate information. If a different rate is desired, set the rate and write the profile manually.

The `SetMutexProfileFraction` method sets the rate of mutex profiling.

The `WriteMutexProfile` method writes a mutex profile to the given file.

The `WriteMemProfile` method writes an allocation profile to the given file. Note that the profiling rate cannot be set through the API, it must be set on the command line.

The `Stacks` method returns a printed representation of the stacks of all goroutines. It also permits an optional filter to be used. The filter is a boolean expression of packages to filter for. The method transforms the input filter into a proper boolean expression that can be fed into a parser and interpreter. It then splits the goroutine dump into segments and filters each segment.

The `FreeOSMemory` method forces a garbage collection. The `OSMemory` function calls the `FreeOSMemory` function from the `debug` package, which frees any unused memory that can be freed by the Go runtime.

The `SetGCPercent` method of the `HandlerT` type sets the garbage collection target percentage and returns the previous setting. A negative value disables garbage collection.

The `writeProfile` function writes a profile of the specified type to the specified file. It looks up the profile by name using the `pprof.Lookup` function, creates a new file with the specified name, writes the profile to the file using the `WriteTo` method of the profile, and closes the file. It returns an error if any of these steps fail.

The `expandHome` function expands the home directory in file paths. If the path starts with `~/` or `~\`, it replaces the `~` with the user's home directory. If the home directory cannot be determined, it leaves the path unchanged. It then cleans the path using the `filepath.Clean` function and returns the cleaned path.
