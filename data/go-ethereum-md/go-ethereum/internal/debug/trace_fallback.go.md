The `debug` package provides tracing functionality for the Ethereum client. This file contains a no-op implementation of tracing methods for Go versions earlier than 1.5.

The `StartGoTrace` method of the `HandlerT` type starts tracing for the Go runtime. It takes a string argument that specifies the file to write the trace to. In this implementation, it returns an error indicating that tracing is not supported on Go versions earlier than 1.5.

The `StopGoTrace` method of the `HandlerT` type stops tracing for the Go runtime. In this implementation, it returns an error indicating that tracing is not supported on Go versions earlier than 1.5.
