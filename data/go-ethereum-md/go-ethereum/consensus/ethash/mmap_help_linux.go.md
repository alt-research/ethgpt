Ethash Package Documentation

The `ethash` package provides an implementation of the Ethash proof-of-work algorithm used by Ethereum. It includes a function to ensure the size of a file on Linux systems.

ensureSize Function

The `ensureSize` function expands the file to the given size. This is to prevent runtime errors later on, if the underlying file expands beyond the disk capacity, even though it ostensibly is already expanded, but due to being sparse does not actually occupy the full declared size on disk. It takes a pointer to an `os.File` object and the desired size of the file in bytes as arguments. It uses the `unix.Fallocate` function to allocate disk space for the file. If the function succeeds, it returns `nil`. If the function fails, it returns an error.
