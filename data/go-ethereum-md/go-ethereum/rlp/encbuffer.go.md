RLP encoding package for Go, which provides an interface for encoding and decoding data in the RLP format. RLP stands for Recursive Length Prefix, and is a method for encoding arbitrarily nested arrays of binary data.

The `encBuffer` type is a buffer used for encoding data in RLP format. It contains a byte slice for the encoded data, as well as a slice of `listhead` structs, which represent the headers for nested lists in the encoded data.

The `getEncBuffer` function returns a new `encBuffer` instance from a global pool of buffers. This is done to reduce the number of allocations required for encoding data.

The `reset` method resets the `encBuffer` instance to its initial state, clearing the encoded data and list headers.

The `size` method returns the length of the encoded data in the buffer.

The `makeBytes` method creates a byte slice containing the encoded data in the buffer.

The `copyTo` method copies the encoded data in the buffer to a destination byte slice.

The `writeTo` method writes the encoded data in the buffer to an `io.Writer` instance.

The `Write` method implements the `io.Writer` interface, allowing data to be directly appended to the encoded data in the buffer.

The `writeBool`, `writeUint64`, `writeBytes`, and `writeString` methods are used to encode various types of data in RLP format. These methods append the encoded data to the `encBuffer` instance.

The `wordBytes` constant is a byte slice containing the encoded data for the empty string, which is used as a placeholder for empty lists in RLP encoding. # Source Code Documentation

## Overview

This codebase provides an implementation of encoding and decoding data structures in Go. It includes functions for writing big integers, lists, and uint256 integers. The codebase also includes an `encReader` type that implements the `io.Reader` interface for reading encoded data.

## Functions

### `writeBigInt`

```go
func (w *encBuffer) writeBigInt(i *big.Int)
```

This function writes a big integer to the `encBuffer` instance. If the integer is less than or equal to 64 bits, it is written as a uint64. Otherwise, it is encoded from the integer's bits.

### `writeUint256`

```go
func (w *encBuffer) writeUint256(z *uint256.Int)
```

This function writes a uint256 integer to the `encBuffer` instance. If the integer is less than or equal to 64 bits, it is written as a uint64. Otherwise, it is encoded as a byte array.

### `list`

```go
func (buf *encBuffer) list() int
```

This function adds a new list header to the header stack and returns the index of the header.

### `listEnd`

```go
func (buf *encBuffer) listEnd(index int)
```

This function should be called after encoding the content of a list. It sets the size of the list header based on the encoded content.

### `encode`

```go
func (buf *encBuffer) encode(val interface{}) error
```

This function encodes a value to the `encBuffer` instance. It uses reflection to determine the type of the value and calls the appropriate encoding function.

### `encodeStringHeader`

```go
func (buf *encBuffer) encodeStringHeader(size int)
```

This function encodes the header for a string of the given size. If the size is less than 56, the header is a single byte. Otherwise, the header includes the size of the string encoded as a variable-length integer.

### `encReader.Read`

```go
func (r *encReader) Read(b []byte) (n int, err error)
```

This function implements the `io.Reader` interface for reading encoded data. It returns the next piece of data to be read and returns `nil` at EOF.

### `encReader.next`

```go
func (r *encReader) next() []byte
```

This function returns the next piece of data to be read by the `encReader`. It returns `nil` at EOF. # Documentation for RLP Encoding Functions

This documentation provides a clear and concise description of each function in the RLP encoding package. The functions are used to encode data in the RLP format.

## len(r.buf.str)

This function returns the string data at the end of the buffer after all list headers. It takes no arguments and returns a string.

## encBufferFromWriter(w io.Writer)

This function returns an encoder buffer from a writer. It takes a writer as an argument and returns an encoder buffer.

## EncoderBuffer

This is a buffer for incremental encoding. The zero value is not ready for use. To get a usable buffer, create it using NewEncoderBuffer or call Reset.

### NewEncoderBuffer(dst io.Writer)

This function creates an encoder buffer. It takes a writer as an argument and returns an encoder buffer.

### Reset(dst io.Writer)

This function truncates the buffer and sets the output destination. It takes a writer as an argument and returns nothing.

### Flush()

This function writes encoded RLP data to the output writer. This can only be called once. If you want to re-use the buffer after Flush, you must call Reset. It returns an error.

### ToBytes()

This function returns the encoded bytes.

### AppendToBytes(dst []byte)

This function appends the encoded bytes to a destination byte slice. It takes a byte slice as an argument and returns a byte slice.

### Write(b []byte)

This function appends a byte slice directly to the encoder output. It takes a byte slice as an argument and returns an integer and an error.

### WriteBool(b bool)

This function writes a boolean value as an integer 0 (false) or 1 (true). It takes a boolean value as an argument and returns nothing.

### WriteUint64(i uint64)

This function encodes an unsigned integer. It takes an unsigned integer as an argument and returns nothing.

### WriteBigInt(i *big.Int)

This function encodes a big.Int as an RLP string. Note: Unlike with Encode, the sign of i is ignored. It takes a big.Int as an argument and returns nothing.

### WriteUint256(i *uint256.Int)

This function encodes uint256.Int as an RLP string. It takes a uint256.Int as an argument and returns nothing.

### WriteBytes(b []byte)

This function encodes a byte slice as an RLP string. It takes a byte slice as an argument and returns nothing.

### WriteString(s string)

This function encodes a string as an RLP string. It takes a string as an argument and returns nothing.

### List()

This function starts a list. It returns an internal index. Call EndList with this index after encoding the content to finish the list. It takes no arguments and returns an integer.

### ListEnd(index int)

This function finishes the given list. It takes an integer as an argument and returns nothing.
