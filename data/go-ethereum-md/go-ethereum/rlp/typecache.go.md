The `rlp` package is a Go implementation of the Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) encoding algorithm. It provides functions for encoding and decoding Go data structures to and from RLP-encoded byte slices.

The `typeinfo` struct is an entry in the type cache. It contains a decoder and a writer function for a specific Go type.

The `typekey` struct is the key of a type in the type cache. It includes the reflect type and the struct tags because they might generate a different decoder.

The `decoder` function is a function that decodes an RLP-encoded byte slice into a Go value.

The `writer` function is a function that encodes a Go value into an RLP-encoded byte slice.

The `typeCache` struct is a cache of type information. It contains a map of `typekey` to `typeinfo`.

The `newTypeCache` function creates a new `typeCache` instance.

The `cachedDecoder` function returns the decoder function for a given Go type from the type cache.

The `cachedWriter` function returns the writer function for a given Go type from the type cache.

The `info` method of the `typeCache` struct returns the `typeinfo` for a given Go type. If the `typeinfo` is not in the cache, it generates it.

The `generate` method of the `typeCache` struct generates the `typeinfo` for a given Go type and adds it to the cache.

The `infoWhileGenerating` method of the `typeCache` struct generates the `typeinfo` for a given Go type while preventing recursive calls to itself.

The `field` struct represents a field in a struct. It contains the field index, the `typeinfo` of the field type, and a flag indicating whether the field is optional.

The `structFields` function resolves the `typeinfo` of all public fields in a struct type. It converts the fields to `rlpstruct.Field`, filters and validates them, and returns a slice of `field`. # RLP Struct Source Code Documentation

The RLP Struct package provides a way to encode and decode Go structs to and from RLP (Recursive Length Prefix) format. This documentation provides an explanation of the functions and types used in the source code.

## `processFields(allStructFields []reflect.StructField) ([]field, error)`

This function processes the struct fields and returns a slice of `field` structs. It takes a slice of all struct fields as input and returns a slice of `field` structs and an error. If there is an error, it returns the error and a `TagError` if the error is of that type. 

## `firstOptionalField(fields []field) int`

This function returns the index of the first field with an "optional" tag. It takes a slice of `field` structs as input and returns an integer.

## `structFieldError`

This is a custom error type that includes the type, field, and error message. It implements the `Error()` method to return a formatted string.

## `generate(typ reflect.Type, tags rlpstruct.Tags)`

This method generates the decoder and writer for a given type and tags. It takes a reflect type and RLP struct tags as input and sets the `decoder` and `decoderErr` fields and `writer` and `writerErr` fields of the `typeinfo` struct.

## `rtypeToStructType(typ reflect.Type, rec map[reflect.Type]*rlpstruct.Type) *rlpstruct.Type`

This function converts a reflect type to an RLP struct type. It takes a reflect type and a map of reflect types to RLP struct types as input and returns an RLP struct type. It recursively calls itself for array, slice, and pointer types.

## `typeNilKind(typ reflect.Type, tags rlpstruct.Tags) Kind`

This function returns the RLP value kind for nil pointers to a given type. It takes a reflect type and RLP struct tags as input and returns a `Kind` value.

## `isUint(k reflect.Kind) bool`

This function returns true if the given reflect kind is a uint type.

## `isByte(typ reflect.Type) bool`

This function returns true if the given reflect type is a uint8 type and does not implement the encoder interface.
