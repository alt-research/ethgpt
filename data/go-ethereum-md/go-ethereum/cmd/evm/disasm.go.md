The code above is a Go program that disassembles an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) binary. The program is licensed under the GNU General Public License and is part of the go-ethereum project.

The program defines a command-line interface using the `urfave/cli` package. The `disasmCommand` variable defines a command named "disasm" that takes a single argument, the path to the EVM binary file to disassemble.

The `disasmCmd` function is the action that is executed when the "disasm" command is invoked. It first checks whether the path to the binary file was provided as an argument or as a value for the `--input` flag. If neither is provided, an error is returned.

If a file path is provided, the contents of the file are read into a string variable named `in`. If an `--input` flag is provided, its value is assigned to `in`.

The `code` variable is then assigned the trimmed value of `in`. The `PrintDisassembled` function from the `asm` package is then called with `code` as its argument. This function prints the disassembled EVM code to the standard output.

Here's an example usage of the program:

```
$ go run disasm.go disasm test.bin
```

This will disassemble the EVM binary file `test.bin` and print the disassembled code to the standard output.
