# Documentation for Go-Ethereum Library

This file is a test file for the Go-Ethereum library. The library is free software that can be redistributed and/or modified under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. This file tests the functionality of the `testReceiveHeaders` function, which tests that custom headers are forwarded to the target when using `geth attach` or `geth db --remotedb`.

## Functions

### `testHandler`

```go
type testHandler struct {
	body func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request)
}
```

The `testHandler` struct defines a handler for HTTP requests. The struct includes a `body` function that is called when a request is received.

### `ServeHTTP`

```go
func (t *testHandler) ServeHTTP(out http.ResponseWriter, in *http.Request)
```

The `ServeHTTP` function handles an incoming HTTP request. The function calls the `body` function of the `testHandler` struct.

### `TestAttachWithHeaders`

```go
func TestAttachWithHeaders(t *testing.T)
```

The `TestAttachWithHeaders` function tests that custom headers are forwarded to the target when using `geth attach`. The function creates a TCP listener, starts an HTTP server, and runs `geth attach` with custom headers. The function then tests that the custom headers were received by the HTTP server.

### `TestRemoteDbWithHeaders`

```go
func TestRemoteDbWithHeaders(t *testing.T)
```

The `TestRemoteDbWithHeaders` function tests that custom headers are forwarded to the target when using `geth db --remotedb`. The function creates a TCP listener, starts an HTTP server, and runs `geth db --remotedb` with custom headers. The function then tests that the custom headers were received by the HTTP server.

### `testReceiveHeaders`

```go
func testReceiveHeaders(t *testing.T, ln net.Listener, gethArgs ...string)
```

The `testReceiveHeaders` function tests that custom headers are forwarded to the target when using `geth attach` or `geth db --remotedb`. The function creates an HTTP server, runs `geth attach` or `geth db --remotedb` with custom headers, and tests that the custom headers were received by the HTTP server.
