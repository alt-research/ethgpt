The code is a part of the go-ethereum project and is licensed under the GNU General Public License. The enrdump command is used to pretty-print node records. The command takes a node record as an argument and outputs a human-readable description of the record. The node record can be provided as a command-line argument or read from a file specified using the -file flag.

The enrdump function is the entry point for the enrdump command. It first checks if the -file flag is set and reads the node record from the file if it is. If the -file flag is not set, it expects the node record to be provided as a command-line argument. The function then calls the parseRecord function to parse the node record and returns an error if the record is invalid. Finally, the function calls the dumpRecord function to output a human-readable description of the node record.

The dumpRecord function takes an io.Writer and an enr.Record as input and outputs a human-readable description of the record to the writer. The function first creates an enode.Node from the record and outputs the node ID and URLv4 if they are available. The function then outputs the sequence number and the number of key/value pairs in the record. Finally, the function calls the dumpRecordKV function to output the key/value pairs in the record.

The dumpRecordKV function takes a slice of key/value pairs and an indentation level as input and outputs a human-readable description of the key/value pairs. The function first determines the longest key name for alignment. It then iterates over the key/value pairs and outputs the key name, value, and a formatter for known keys. If a formatter is not available for a key, the function outputs the raw value as a hex-encoded string.

The parseNode function is not used in the enrdump command but is included in the code for completeness. The function parses a node record and verifies its signature. If the node record is provided as an enode URL, the function calls the enode.ParseV4 function to parse the URL. Otherwise, the function calls the parseRecord function to parse the node record and creates an enode.Node from the record.

Overall, the code provides a command-line tool for pretty-printing node records and includes functions for parsing and creating enode.Nodes from node records. The code is well-documented and follows the GNU General Public License. # ENR Package

The `ENR` package provides functions for encoding and decoding Ethereum Node Records (ENRs).

## Encode Function

The `Encode` function encodes an ENR into a byte slice. It has the following signature:

```go
func Encode(r *enr.Record) ([]byte, error)
```

### Parameters

- `r`: The ENR to encode.

### Return Value

The function returns a byte slice and an error.

## Decode Function

The `Decode` function decodes an ENR from a byte slice. It has the following signature:

```go
func Decode(source string) (*enr.Record, error)
```

### Parameters

- `source`: The byte slice to decode.

### Return Value

The function returns an ENR and an error.

## decodeRecordHex Function

The `decodeRecordHex` function decodes a hex-encoded ENR from a byte slice. It has the following
