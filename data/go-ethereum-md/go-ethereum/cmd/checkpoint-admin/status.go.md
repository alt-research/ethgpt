The above code is written in Go and is a part of the go-ethereum project. It defines a command-line interface (CLI) command called "status" that fetches the signers and checkpoint status of the oracle contract. The CLI command takes a node URL flag as input.

The `status` function is the main function that is executed when the "status" command is run. It takes a `cli.Context` object as input and returns an error if any. The function creates a wrapper around the checkpoint oracle contract and retrieves the list of authorized signers (admins) and the latest checkpoint. It then prints the retrieved data to the console.

The `commandStatus` variable is a `cli.Command` object that defines the "status" command. It specifies the name, usage, flags, and action of the command. The `nodeURLFlag` is a flag that specifies the URL of the node to connect to.

The `newContract` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, but it is likely a helper function that creates a new instance of the checkpoint oracle contract.

The code also includes a license header that specifies the terms under which the code can be used and distributed.
