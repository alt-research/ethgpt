## Variables

### field modulus q

```go
4002409555221667393417789825735904156556882819939007885332058136124031650490837864442687629129015664037894272559787
```

The field modulus q is a constant value used in the field arithmetic operations.

- The code is generated by goff and should not be edited manually.
- The code has not been audited and is provided as-is. There are no security guarantees such as constant time implementation or side-channel attack resistance. # Fe Package Documentation

## Field Element Representation

Field elements are represented as arrays of 6 uint64 values. The field modulus is:

```
q = 2^252 + 27742317777372353535851937790883648493
```

The field element is reduced modulo q after each arithmetic operation to ensure that it remains within the field.

The arithmetic operations in this package are not constant-time. It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the inputs do not cause any side-channel attacks. # Source Code Documentation
