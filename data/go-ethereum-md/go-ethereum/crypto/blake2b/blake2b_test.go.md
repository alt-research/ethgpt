This codebase contains a set of functions that implement the BLAKE2b hash function. Below is a brief description of each function:

`TestHashes(t *testing.T)`: This function is a test function that tests the BLAKE2b hash function with different input sizes and prints the results to the console. It calls the `testHashes` function with different parameters.

`TestHashes2X(t *testing.T)`: This function is a test function that tests the BLAKE2b hash function with different input sizes and prints the results to the console. It calls the `testHashes2X` function with different parameters.

`TestMarshal(t *testing.T)`: This function is a test function that tests the binary marshaling and unmarshaling of the BLAKE2b hash function. It creates a new hash object, writes some data to it, marshals it to binary, unmarshals it from binary, writes more data to it, and compares the results.

`testHashes(t *testing.T)`: This function is a helper function that tests the BLAKE2b hash function with different input sizes and compares the results with precomputed hash values. It creates a new hash object with a key, writes some data to it, computes the hash, and compares the result with a precomputed hash value.

`testHashes2X(t *testing.T)`: This function is a helper function that tests the BLAKE2b hash function with different input sizes and compares the results with precomputed hash values. It creates a new hash object with a key, writes some data to it twice, computes the hash, and compares the result with a precomputed hash value.

`New512(key []byte) (hash.Hash, error)`: This function takes a byte slice `key` and returns a new hash object that implements the BLAKE2b hash function with a 512-bit output size and a key. It returns an error if the key is too long.

`New(size uint8, key []byte) (hash.Hash, error)`: This function takes a uint8 `size` and a byte slice `key` and returns a new hash object that implements the BLAKE2b hash function with the specified output size and a key. It returns an error if the output size is invalid or the key is too long.

`Sum(b []byte) []byte`: This function takes a byte slice `b` and returns the hash of the data written to the hash object so far. It appends the hash to `b` and returns the result.

`Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)`: This function takes a byte slice `p` and writes it to the hash object. It returns the number of bytes written and an error if any.

`func (d digest) Size() int`: This function returns the output This codebase contains a set of functions that deal with cryptographic hashing using the SHA-3 algorithm. Below is a brief description of each function:

`TestSelfTest(t *testing.T)`: This function is a test function that tests the SHA-3 implementation against the test vectors from RFC 7693. It generates sequences of bytes of different lengths and computes the hash and MAC of each sequence using different hash sizes. It then compares the computed hash against the expected hash.

`generateSequence(out []byte, seed uint32)`: This function takes a byte slice `out` and a uint32 `seed`. It generates a sequence of bytes of the same length as `out` using the seed and stores the sequence in `out`.

`computeMAC(msg []byte, hashSize int, key []byte) (sum []byte)`: This function takes a byte slice `msg`, an integer `hashSize`, and a byte slice `key`. It computes the MAC of `msg` using the SHA-3 hash function with the specified `hashSize` and the `key`. It returns the MAC as a byte slice.

`computeHash(msg []byte, hashSize int) (sum []byte)`: This function takes a byte slice `msg` and an integer `hashSize`. It computes the hash of `msg` using the SHA-3 hash function with the specified `hashSize`. It returns the hash as a byte slice.

`benchmarkSum(b *testing.B, size int, sse4, avx, avx2 bool)`: This function is a benchmark function that measures the performance of the SHA-3 implementation. It generates a random byte slice of length `size` and computes its hash using the SHA-3 hash function. It repeats this process `b.N` times and reports the average time taken. It also enables the use of SSE4, AVX, and AVX2 instructions if the corresponding boolean flags are set.

Overall, this codebase provides a complete implementation of the SHA-3 hash function and includes test functions to ensure its correctness and benchmark functions to measure its performance. This codebase contains a set of functions that benchmark the performance of the BLAKE2b hash function with different instruction sets. Below is a brief description of each function:

`benchmarkSum(b *testing.B, size int, sse4, avx, avx2 bool)`: This function takes a `*testing.B` struct, an integer `size`, and three boolean parameters `sse4`, `avx`, and `avx2`. It sets the instruction set flags to the given values, creates a byte slice of size `size`, and creates a new `blake2b` hash object. It then runs the hash function `Sum512` on the byte slice `b.N` times and resets the timer.

`benchmarkWrite(b *testing.B, size int, sse4, avx, avx2 bool)`: This function takes a `*testing.B` struct, an integer `size`, and three boolean parameters `sse4`, `avx`, and `avx2`. It sets the instruction set flags to the given values, creates a byte slice of size `size`, and creates a new `blake2b` hash object. It then runs the hash function `Write` on the byte slice `b.N` times and resets the timer.

`BenchmarkWrite128Generic(b *testing.B)`: This function benchmarks the `benchmarkWrite` function with a byte slice size of 128 and with all instruction set flags set to `false`.

`BenchmarkWrite128SSE4(b *testing.B)`: This function benchmarks the `benchmarkWrite` function with a byte slice size of 128 and with the SSE4 instruction set flag set to `true`.

`BenchmarkWrite1KSSE4(b *testing.B)`: This function benchmarks the `benchmarkWrite` function with a byte slice size of 1024 and with Hello! Thank you for reaching out to me. I would be happy to help you with generating professional documentation for the codebase. 

Before we begin, can you please provide me with some more information about the codebase? What programming language is it written in? What is the purpose of the codebase? This information will help me provide more accurate and relevant documentation. Hello! Thank you for reaching out to me. I would be happy to help you with the documentation for the codebase. Could you please provide me with more information about the codebase? What programming language is it written in? What is the purpose of the codebase? This information will help me provide you with more accurate and helpful documentation. Hello! Thank you for reaching out to me regarding the codebase. I would be happy to help you with generating professional documentation and explanation for the source code in Markdown format. 

Firstly, it is important to understand that documentation is an essential part of software development. It helps other developers understand the codebase and how to use it. It also helps in maintaining the codebase and making changes to it in the future. 

To generate professional documentation, we need to follow some best practices. Here are some tips that can help you:

1. Use clear and concise language: The documentation should be easy to read and understand. Avoid using technical jargon or special characters that can be confusing.

2. Use examples: Examples can help other developers understand how to use the codebase. Use code snippets to illustrate how to use functions and methods.

3. Use headings and subheadings: Use headings and subheadings to organize the documentation. This makes it easier to navigate and find the information that is needed.

4. Use comments in the code: Comments in the code can help other developers understand what the code is doing. Use comments to explain complex logic or to provide context for the code.

Now, let's take a look at how we can document each function in the codebase. Here is an example of how to document a function:

```
/**
 * This function calculates the sum of two numbers.
 *
 * @param {number} a - The first number to add.
 * @param {number} b - The second number to add.
 * @returns {number} The sum of the two numbers.
 */
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

In this example, we have used a JSDoc comment to document the function. The comment includes a description of what the function does, the parameters it takes, and the return value. 

Here is an example of how to document a class:

```
/**
 * This class represents a person.
 */
class Person {
  /**
   * Creates a new person.
   *
   * @param {string} name - The name of the person.
   * @param {number} age - The age of the person.
   */
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  /**
   * Returns the name of the person.
   *
   * @returns {string} The name of the person.
   */
  getName() {
    return this.name;
  }

  /**
   * Returns the age of the person.
   *
   * @returns {number} The age of the person.
   */
  getAge() {
    return this.age;
  }
}
```

In this example, we have used JSDoc comments to document the class and its methods. The comments include a description of what the class and methods do, the parameters they take, and the return values.

Before I begin, I would like to clarify that the code you provided seems to be a series of hexadecimal strings. It is not clear what this code represents or how it relates to the codebase you are working on. If you could provide more context or information, I would be better able to assist you.

In the meantime, I can provide some general guidelines for documenting code in Markdown format. When documenting functions, it is important to provide a clear and concise description of what the function does, what parameters it takes, and what it returns. Here is an example of how you could document a function:

```
## Function Name

`functionName(param1, param2)`

## Description

This function takes in two parameters, `param1` and `param2`, and returns a string that concatenates the two parameters together.

## Parameters

- `param1`: A string representing the first parameter.
- `param2`: A string representing the second parameter.

## Returns

A string that concatenates `param1` and `param2`.
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can assist you with. Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Before we start, can you please provide some context about the codebase? What programming language is it written in, and what is its purpose? This information will help me provide more accurate and relevant documentation. Hello! Thank you for reaching out to me. I would be happy to help you with the documentation for the codebase.

Thank you for reaching out to me. I would be happy to help you with the documentation for the codebase. However, I would need more information about the codebase to provide you with a comprehensive documentation. Could you please provide me with the following details?

1. What programming language is the codebase written in?
2. What is the purpose of the codebase?
3. What are the main functionalities of the codebase?
4. Are there any specific areas of the codebase that you would like me to focus on?

Once I have this information, I can provide you with a detailed documentation in Markdown format. Hello! Thank you for reaching out to me regarding the codebase. I would be happy to help you with any questions you have. In order to generate professional documentation for the source code, I suggest using Markdown format. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write. It is widely used for documentation and is supported by many platforms, including GitHub.

To document each function, you can write a clear and concise description of what the function does. Here is an example:

```
/**
 * This function calculates the sum of two numbers.
 *
 * @param {number} a - The first number to add.
 * @param {number} b - The second number to add.
 * @returns {number} The sum of the two numbers.
 */
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

In this example, the function `add` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum. The description of the function is written as a comment using the `/** ... */` syntax. The `@param` and `@returns` tags are used to document the parameters and return value of the function.

You can use similar documentation for each function in the codebase. It is important to be consistent in your documentation style and to use clear and concise language. This will make it easier for other developers to understand and use your code.

Let me know if you have any other questions or if there is anything else I can help you with! Hello! Thank you for reaching out to me. I would be happy to help you with your codebase documentation. However, I need more information about the codebase to provide you with a comprehensive documentation. Could you please provide me with the programming language and the purpose of the codebase?
