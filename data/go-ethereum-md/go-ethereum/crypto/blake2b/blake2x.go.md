This codebase contains an implementation of the BLAKE2b hash function that supports variable-length output (XOF). Below is a brief description of each function:

`XOF`: This is an interface that defines the methods required for a hash function that supports arbitrary-length output. It extends the `io.Writer` and `io.Reader` interfaces and adds two additional methods: `Clone` and `Reset`.

`OutputLengthUnknown`: This is a constant that can be used as the size argument to `NewXOF` to indicate that the length of the output is not known in advance.

`magicUnknownOutputLength`: This is a constant that represents a magic value for the output size that indicates an unknown number of output bytes.

`maxOutputLength`: This is a constant that represents the absolute maximum number of bytes to produce when the number of output bytes is unknown.

`NewXOF(size uint32, key []byte) (XOF, error)`: This function creates a new variable-output-length hash. The hash either produces a known number of bytes (1 <= size < 2**32-1), or an unknown number of bytes (size == OutputLengthUnknown). In the latter case, an absolute limit of 256GiB applies. A non-nil key turns the hash into a MAC. The key must be between zero and 32 bytes long.

`xof`: This is a struct that implements the `XOF` interface. It contains the state of the hash function, including the digest, length, remaining bytes, configuration, root, block, offset, node offset, and read mode.

`Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)`: This method implements the `io.Writer` interface. It writes more data into the hash's state. It panics if called after `Read`.

`Clone() XOF`: This method implements the `Clone` method of the `XOF` interface. It returns a copy of the XOF in its current state.

`Reset()`: This method implements the `Reset` method of the `XOF` interface. It resets the XOF to its initial state.

`Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)`: This method implements the `io.Reader` interface. It reads more output from the hash. It returns `io.EOF` if the limit has been reached.

`finalize(out *[Size]byte)`: This method finalizes the hash and writes the result to the `out` byte array.

`initConfig(cfg *[Size]byte)`: This method initializes the hash's configuration with the given byte array.

`digest`: This is a struct that represents the state of the hash function. It contains the size, key length, h, t, f, and buf fields.

`errKeySize`: This is an error that is returned when the key size is greater than the hash size. This codebase contains a set of functions that deal with the BLAKE2b hash function. Below is a brief description of each function:

`New256`: This function returns a new BLAKE2b hash with a 256-bit output size.

`New512`: This function returns a new BLAKE2b hash with a 512-bit output size.

`Sum256`: This function takes a byte slice `data` and returns a 256-bit BLAKE2b hash of the data.

`Sum512`: This function takes a byte slice `data` and returns a 512-bit BLAKE2b hash of the data.

`block(d *digest, p []byte)`: This function takes a pointer to a `digest` struct and a byte slice `p`. It processes the data in the byte slice in blocks of `BlockSize` bytes and updates the hash state accordingly.

`compress(d *digest, block *[BlockSize]byte, last bool)`: This function takes a pointer to a `digest` struct, a pointer to a `[BlockSize]byte` array, and a boolean `last`. It compresses the block using the BLAKE2b compression function and updates the hash state accordingly. If `last` is `true`, it sets the last block flag in the hash state.

`finalize(d *digest, out *[Size]byte)`: This function takes a pointer to a `digest` struct and a pointer to a `[Size]byte` array. It finalizes the hash by padding the remaining data, processing the last block, and outputting the hash to the byte array.

`writeBlock(d *digest, p []byte)`: This function takes a pointer to a `digest` struct and a byte slice `p`. It writes the data in the byte slice to the hash state in blocks of `BlockSize` bytes and compresses each block.

`write(d *digest, p []byte)`: This function takes a pointer to a `digest` struct and a byte slice `p`. It writes the data in the byte slice to the hash state in chunks of `BlockSize` bytes and compresses each chunk.

`initConfig(cfg *[Size]byte)`: This function takes a pointer to a `[Size]byte` array and initializes the hash configuration.

Overall, these functions provide a way to compute BLAKE2b hashes of data in various sizes. The `block`, `compress`, and `finalize` functions are the core of the hash computation, while the `writeBlock` and `write` functions provide a way to write data to the hash state in blocks or chunks. The `initConfig` function initializes the hash configuration based on the hash size and other parameters.
