This codebase contains two test functions for the `linkCache` struct in the `dnsdisc` package.

1. `func TestLinkCache(t *testing.T)`: This test function tests the `linkCache` struct's methods for adding and removing links between nodes. It first creates an empty `linkCache` struct. It then adds links between nodes using the `addLink()` method and checks if the `changed` flag is set after each addition. It also checks if the `isReferenced()` method correctly reports whether a node is referenced by any other node. Finally, it resets the links for a node using the `resetLinks()` method and checks if the `changed` flag is set and if the reference maps are empty.

2. `func TestLinkCacheRandom(t *testing.T *testing.T)`: This test function tests the `linkCache` struct's methods for adding and removing links between nodes with random data. It first creates an array of 1000 strings representing node tags. It then adds 100 random links between nodes using the `addLink()` method and stores the tags of one of the nodes in each link in an array. It then removes all the links for each of the stored tags using the `resetLinks()` method and checks if the reference maps are empty.
