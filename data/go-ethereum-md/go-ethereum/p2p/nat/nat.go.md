The code is a part of the go-ethereum library and provides access to common network port mapping protocols. It defines an interface `nat.Interface` that can map local ports to ports accessible from the Internet. The interface has methods to add and delete port mappings, get the external IP address of the gateway device, and return the name of the method.

The `Parse` function parses a NAT interface description and returns an implementation of the `nat.Interface` interface. The function accepts the following formats:

- "" or "none": returns nil
- "extip:77.12.33.4": assumes the local machine is reachable on the given IP
- "any": uses the first auto-detected mechanism
- "upnp": uses the Universal Plug and Play protocol
- "pmp": uses NAT-PMP with an auto-detected gateway address
- "pmp:192.168.0.1": uses NAT-PMP with the given gateway address

The `Map` function adds a port mapping on the given NAT interface and keeps it alive until the given channel is closed. The function is typically invoked in its own goroutine. It logs the port mapping information and deletes the mapping when the channel is closed or the mapping lifetime ends. 

Here's an example usage of the `nat` package:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/log"
	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/p2p/nat"
)

func main() {
	// Parse the NAT interface description
	iface, err := nat.Parse("upnp")
	if err != nil {
		log.Error("Failed to parse NAT interface", "err", err)
		return
	}

	// Add a port mapping
	extport := 12345
	intport := 54321
	name := "myapp"
	done := make(chan struct{})
	go nat.Map(iface, done, "tcp", extport, intport, name)

	// Wait for the port mapping to be added
	time.Sleep(time.Second)

	// Get the external IP address of the gateway device
	ip, err := iface.ExternalIP()
	if err != nil {
		log.Error("Failed to get external IP address", "err", err)
		return
	}

	// Print the port mapping information
	fmt.Printf("Mapped port %d to %s:%d\n", intport, ip, extport)

	// Wait for the port mapping to expire
	time.Sleep(2 * time.Minute)

	// Close the channel to delete the port mapping
	close(done)
}
``` ## Introduction

This codebase provides a Go implementation of a port mapping library. It allows for the mapping of external ports to internal ports on a local network. The library supports two protocols: UPnP and NAT-PMP. The codebase consists of several functions and types that are described below.

## Functions

### func Any() Interface

`Any` returns a port mapper that tries to discover any supported mechanism on the local network. It attempts to discover whether the local machine has an Internet-class address. If it does, it returns an `ExtIP` type. Otherwise, it attempts to discover the router using UPnP or NAT-PMP.

### func UPnP() Interface

`UPnP` returns a port mapper that uses UPnP. It attempts to discover the address of the router using UDP broadcasts.

### func PMP(gateway net.IP) Interface

`PMP` returns a port mapper that uses NAT-PMP. The provided gateway address should be the IP of the router. If the given gateway address is nil, PMP will attempt to auto-discover the router.

## Types

### type Interface

`Interface` is an interface that defines the methods required for a port mapper. It has the following methods:

#### func (n ExtIP) ExternalIP() (net.IP, error)

`ExternalIP` returns the external IP address of the local machine.

#### func (n ExtIP) String() string

`String` returns a string representation of the `ExtIP` type.

#### func (n *autodisc) AddMapping(protocol string, extport, intport int, name string, lifetime time.Duration) error

`AddMapping` adds a port mapping from an external port to an internal port.

#### func (n *autodisc) DeleteMapping(protocol string, extport, intport int) error

`DeleteMapping` deletes a port mapping from an external port to an internal port.

#### func (n *autodisc) ExternalIP() (net.IP, error)

`ExternalIP` returns the external IP address of the router.

#### func (n *autodisc) String() string

`String` returns a string representation of the `autodisc` type.

### type ExtIP net.IP

`ExtIP` is a type that assumes that the local machine is reachable on the given external IP address, and that any required ports were mapped manually. Mapping operations will not return an error but won't actually do anything. It has the following methods:

#### func (n ExtIP) ExternalIP() (net.IP, error)

`ExternalIP` returns the external IP address of the local machine.

#### func (n ExtIP) String() string

`String` returns a string representation of the `ExtIP` type.

#### func (ExtIP) AddMapping(string, int, int, string, time.Duration) error

`AddMapping` does nothing.

#### func (ExtIP) DeleteMapping(string, int, int) error

`DeleteMapping` does nothing.

### type autodisc struct

`autodisc` represents a port mapping mechanism that is still being auto-discovered. Calls to the `Interface` methods on this type will wait until the discovery is done and then call the method on the discovered mechanism. This type is useful because discovery can take a while but we want to return an `Interface` value from `UPnP`, `PMP` and `Auto` immediately. It has the following methods:

#### func startautodisc(what string, doit func() Interface) Interface

`startautodisc` starts the auto-discovery process for a given port mapping mechanism.

#### func (n *autodisc) AddMapping(protocol string, extport, intport int, name string, lifetime time.Duration) error

`AddMapping` adds a port mapping from an external port to an internal port.

#### func (n *autodisc) DeleteMapping(protocol string, extport, intport int) error

`DeleteMapping` deletes a port mapping from an external port to an internal port.

#### func (n *autodisc) ExternalIP() (net.IP, error)

`ExternalIP` returns the external IP address of the router.

#### func (n *autodisc) String() string

`String` returns a string representation of the `autodisc` type.

#### func (n *autodisc) wait() error

`wait` blocks until auto-discovery has been performed.
