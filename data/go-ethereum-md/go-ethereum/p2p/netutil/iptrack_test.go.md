## netutil package

The `netutil` package provides utilities for network-related operations.

### TestIPTracker

The `TestIPTracker` function is a test function that tests the `IPTracker` struct. It takes a testing object and a map of test cases as input. Each test case is a slice of `iptrackTestEvent` structs that represent events in the IP tracking process. The function runs each test case and checks the output of the `IPTracker` struct against the expected output.

### runIPTrackerTest

The `runIPTrackerTest` function is a helper function for `TestIPTracker`. It takes a testing object and a slice of `iptrackTestEvent` structs as input. It creates a `mclock.Simulated` object to simulate time and an `IPTracker` object to track IP addresses. It then runs each event in the slice and checks the output of the `IPTracker` object against the expected output.

### TestIPTrackerForceGC

The `TestIPTrackerForceGC` function is a test function that tests the garbage collection of old statements and contacts in the `IPTracker` struct. It creates a `mclock.Simulated` object to simulate time and an `IPTracker` object with a short window and high rate to force garbage collection. It then adds statements and contacts to the `IPTracker` object and checks that old statements and contacts are garbage collected even if `Predict*` isn't called.

### iptrackTestEvent

The `iptrackTestEvent` struct represents an event in the IP tracking process. It has four fields:

- `op`: an integer representing the type of event (statement, contact, predict, or check full cone)
- `time`: an integer representing the absolute time of the event in milliseconds
- `ip`: a string representing an IP address
- `from`: a string representing the source of the IP address

### IPTracker

The `IPTracker` struct tracks IP addresses and predicts the endpoint and NAT type of a peer. It has four fields:

- `window`: a `time.Duration` representing the time window for tracking statements
- `contactWindow`: a `time.Duration` representing the time window for tracking contacts
- `maxStatements`: an integer representing the maximum number of statements to track
- `statements`: a map of `string` to `[]string` representing the statements tracked by the IP tracker
- `contacts`: a map of `string` to `time.Time` representing the contacts tracked by the IP tracker
- `clock`: a `mclock.Clock` object representing the clock used by the IP tracker

The `IPTracker` struct has four methods:

- `AddStatement(from string, ip string)`: adds a statement to the IP tracker
- `AddContact(from string)`: adds a contact to the IP tracker
- `PredictEndpoint() string`: predicts the endpoint of a peer
- `PredictFullConeNAT() bool`: predicts the NAT type of a peer (full cone or not)

## Conclusion

The `netutil` package provides utilities for network-related operations. The `IPTracker` struct tracks IP addresses and predicts the endpoint and NAT type of a peer. The `TestIPTracker` and `TestIPTrackerForceGC` functions test the `IPTracker` struct. The code above is a Go test function that tests the garbage collection behavior of a "StatementIterator" struct. The test creates a new "StatementIterator" with a maximum number of contacts and statements, and adds random contacts and statements to it at a given rate using a "clock" struct. The test then checks that the number of contacts and statements in the iterator is less than or equal to twice the maximum number of contacts and statements, respectively.

The function uses the "crypto/rand" package to generate random bytes for the contacts and statements, and the "clock" struct to control the rate at which they are added to the iterator.

Here is an example usage of the "StatementIterator" struct:

```
it := &StatementIterator{maxContacts: 100, maxStatements: 1000}
e1 := make([]byte, 4)
e2 := make([]byte, 4)
crand.Read(e1)
crand.Read(e2)
it.AddStatement(string(e1), string(e2))
it.AddContact(string(e1))
```
