Sure, let's go through the code and document each function. Here's an example of how we can document a function in Markdown format:

```
## Function Name

Description of what the function does.

### Parameters

- `param1`: Description of the first parameter.
- `param2`: Description of the second parameter.

### Returns

Description of what the function returns.

### Example

```go
funcName(param1, param2)
```
```

We can use this format to document each function in the codebase. Let's start with the first block of code you provided:
