The code above is a Go package named "pipes" that provides two functions for creating in-process pipes using the net package. The first function, "NetPipe", wraps the net.Pipe function in a signature that returns an error. The second function, "TCPPipe", creates a full duplex pipe based on a localhost TCP socket.

The "NetPipe" function creates a pair of connected net.Conn objects using the net.Pipe function and returns them along with a nil error. The net.Pipe function creates a synchronous, in-memory, full duplex network connection that can be used for inter-process communication.

The "TCPPipe" function creates a pair of connected net.Conn objects using a TCP socket. It first listens on a randomly assigned localhost TCP port using net.Listen, then spawns a goroutine to accept incoming connections. It then dials the same TCP port and waits for the goroutine to accept the connection. Once both connections are established, it returns them along with a nil error.

Here is an example usage of the "NetPipe" function:

```
c1, c2, err := pipes.NetPipe()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer c1.Close()
defer c2.Close()

// Use c1 and c2 for inter-process communication
```

And here is an example usage of the "TCPPipe" function:

```
c1, c2, err := pipes.TCPPipe()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer c1.Close()
defer c2.Close()

// Use c1 and c2 for inter-process communication
```
