Certainly, I can help you with that! Here's an example of how you could document the code you provided in Markdown format:

## Metrics Package

The `metrics` package provides functionality for collecting and reporting metrics.

### `init()` Function

The `init()` function is a special function in Go that is called automatically when the package is imported. In this case, the `init()` function sets the `Enabled` variable to `true`.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you could use the `metrics` package in your Go code:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/myusername/mymodule/metrics"
)

func main() {
    // Enable metrics
    metrics.Enabled = true

    // Do some work...

    // Report metrics
    metrics.Report()

    // Disable metrics
    metrics.Enabled = false
}
```

In this example, we import the `metrics` package and enable metrics by setting the `Enabled` variable to `true`. We then do some work and report the metrics using the `Report()` function provided by the `metrics` package. Finally, we disable metrics by setting the `Enabled` variable to `false`.
