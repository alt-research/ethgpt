## Meter Interface

The `Meter` interface defines several functions that can be used to count events and produce exponentially-weighted moving average rates at one-, five-, and fifteen-minutes and a mean rate.

### Functions

#### `Count() int64`

This function returns the count of events.

#### `Mark(int64)`

This function marks an event.

#### `Rate1() float64`

This function returns the one-minute moving average rate of events per second.

#### `Rate5() float64`

This function returns the five-minute moving average rate of events per second.

#### `Rate15() float64`

This function returns the fifteen-minute moving average rate of events per second.

#### `RateMean() float64`

This function returns the mean rate of events per second.

#### `Snapshot() Meter`

This function returns a read-only copy of the meter.

#### `Stop()`

This function stops the meter.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you could use the `Meter` interface in your Go code:

```go
import (
    "github.com/rcrowley/go-metrics"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new meter
    meter := metrics.NewMeter()

    // Mark some events
    meter.Mark(1)
    meter.Mark(2)
    meter.Mark(3)

    // Get the count of events
    count := meter.Count()
    fmt.Println("Count:", count)

    // Get the one-minute moving average rate of events per second
    rate1 := meter.Rate1()
    fmt.Println("Rate1:", rate1)

    // Get the five-minute moving average rate of events per second
    rate5 := meter.Rate5()
    fmt.Println("Rate5:", rate5)

    // Get the fifteen-minute moving average rate of events per second
    rate15 := meter.Rate15()
    fmt.Println("Rate15:", rate15)

    // Get the mean rate of events per second
    rateMean := meter.RateMean()
    fmt.Println("RateMean:", rateMean)

    // Get a read-only copy of the meter
    snapshot := meter.Snapshot()

    // Stop the meter
    meter.Stop()
}
```

In this example, we create a new meter using the `NewMeter` function and mark some events using the `Mark` function. We then use the various functions provided by the `Meter` interface to get the count of events and the one-, five-, and fifteen-minute moving average rates of events per second, as well as the mean rate of events per second. We also use the `Snapshot` function to get a read-only copy of the meter and the `Stop` function to stop the meter. Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you could use the `Meter` interface in your Go code:

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "time"

    "github.com/rcrowley/go-metrics"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new meter
    meter := metrics.NewMeter()

    // Record some events
    meter.Mark(1)
    meter.Mark(2)
    meter.Mark(3)

    // Get the meter's count
    count := meter.Count()
    fmt.Println("Count:", count)

    // Get the meter's one-minute moving average rate
    rate1 := meter.Rate1()
    fmt.Println("One-minute moving average rate:", rate1)

    // Get the meter's five-minute moving average rate
    rate5 := meter.Rate5()
    fmt.Println("Five-minute moving average rate:", rate5)

    // Get the meter's fifteen-minute moving average rate

## meterArbiter Struct

The `meterArbiter` struct is used to tick meters every 5 seconds from a single goroutine. Meters are references in a set for future stopping.

### Fields

#### `started` (bool)

This field is used to indicate whether the meter arbiter has been started.

#### `meters` (map[*StandardMeter]struct{})

This field is used to store references to the meters that the arbiter is ticking.

#### `ticker` (*time.Ticker)

This field is used to store a reference to the ticker that is used to tick the meters.

### Functions

#### `tick()`

This function is used to tick meters on the scheduled interval. It takes no parameters.

#### `tickMeters()`

This function is used to tick the meters that have been added to the arbiter. It takes no parameters.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you could use the `meterArbiter` struct in your Go code:

```go
import (
    "sync"
    "time"
)

type StandardMeter struct {
    // ...
}

func main() {
    // Create a new meter arbiter
    arbiter := &meterArbiter{meters: make(map[*StandardMeter]struct{}), ticker: time.NewTicker(5 * time.Second)}

    // Add meters to the arbiter
    meter1 := &StandardMeter{}
    meter2 := &StandardMeter{}
    arbiter.addMeter(meter1)
    arbiter.addMeter(meter2)

    // Start the arbiter
    arbiter.start()

    // Wait for some time
    time.Sleep(30 * time.Second)

    // Stop the arbiter
    arbiter.stop()
}

func (ma *meterArbiter) addMeter(meter *StandardMeter) {
    ma.Lock()
    defer ma.Unlock()
    ma.meters[meter] = struct{}{}
}

func (ma *meterArbiter) start() {
    ma.Lock()
    defer ma.Unlock()
    if !ma.started {
        ma.started = true
        go ma.tick()
    }
}

func (ma *meterArbiter) stop() {
    ma.Lock()
    defer ma.Unlock()
    if ma.started {
        ma.started = false
        ma.ticker.Stop()
    }
}

func (ma *meterArbiter) tick() {
    for range ma.ticker.C {
        ma.tickMeters()
    }
}

func (ma *meterArbiter) tickMeters() {
    ma.RLock()
    defer ma.RUnlock()
    for meter := range ma.meters {
        meter.tick()
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a new `meterArbiter` and add two meters to it. We then start the arbiter and wait for some time before stopping it. The `addMeter` function is used to add meters to the arbiter, the `start` function is used to start the arbiter, the `stop` function is used to stop the arbiter, the `tick` function is used to tick meters on the scheduled interval, and the `tickMeters` function is used to tick the meters that have been added to the arbiter.
