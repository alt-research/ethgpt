Certainly, I can help you with that! Here's an example of how you could document the code you provided in Markdown format:

## Metrics Package

The `metrics` package provides functionality for capturing and registering metrics related to the Go garbage collector statistics exported in `debug.GCStats`.

### Variables

#### `debugMetrics` (struct)

The `debugMetrics` struct contains several fields that represent the various metrics related to the Go garbage collector statistics.

#### `gcStats` (debug.GCStats)

The `gcStats` variable represents the Go garbage collector statistics.

### Functions

#### `CaptureDebugGCStats(r Registry, d time.Duration)`

This function captures new values for the Go garbage collector statistics exported in `debug.GCStats`. It is designed to be called as a goroutine. It takes two parameters:

- `r` (Registry): The registry to use for registering the metrics.
- `d` (time.Duration): The duration between captures.

#### `CaptureDebugGCStatsOnce(r Registry)`

This function captures new values for the Go garbage collector statistics exported in `debug.GCStats`. It is designed to be called in a background goroutine. It takes one parameter:

- `r` (Registry): The registry to use for registering the metrics.

#### `RegisterDebugGCStats(r Registry)`

This function registers metrics for the Go garbage collector statistics exported in `debug.GCStats`. The metrics are named by their fully-qualified Go symbols, i.e. `debug.GCStats.PauseTotal`. It takes one parameter:

- `r` (Registry): The registry to use for registering the metrics.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you could use the `metrics` package in your Go code:

```go
import (
    "time"
    "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/metrics"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new registry
    registry := metrics.NewRegistry()

    // Register the debug GC stats
    metrics.RegisterDebugGCStats(registry)

    // Capture the debug GC stats every 10 seconds
    go metrics.CaptureDebugGCStats(registry, 10*time.Second)

    // Do some work...

    // Get the last GC time
    lastGC := metrics.GetOrRegisterGaugeFloat64("debug.GCStats.LastGC", registry).Value()

    // Print the last GC time
    fmt.Printf("Last GC time: %f\n", lastGC)
}
```

In this example, we create a new registry and register the debug GC stats using the `RegisterDebugGCStats` function. We then capture the debug GC stats every 10 seconds using the `CaptureDebugGCStats` function. Finally, we get the last GC time using the `GetOrRegisterGaugeFloat64` function and print it out using the `fmt.Printf` function.
