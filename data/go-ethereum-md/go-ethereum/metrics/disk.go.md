Certainly, I can help you with that! Here's an example of how you could document the code you provided in Markdown format:

## DiskStats Struct

The `DiskStats` struct represents the per-process disk I/O statistics.

### Fields

#### `ReadCount` (int64)

The number of read operations executed.

#### `ReadBytes` (int64)

The total number of bytes read.

#### `WriteCount` (int64)

The number of write operations executed.

#### `WriteBytes` (int64)

The total number of bytes written.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you could use the `DiskStats` struct in your Go code:

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/metrics"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new DiskStats struct
    stats := &metrics.DiskStats{
        ReadCount:  10,
        ReadBytes:  1024,
        WriteCount: 5,
        WriteBytes: 512,
    }

    // Print the disk I/O statistics
    fmt.Printf("Read count: %d\n", stats.ReadCount)
    fmt.Printf("Read bytes: %d\n", stats.ReadBytes)
    fmt.Printf("Write count: %d\n", stats.WriteCount)
    fmt.Printf("Write bytes: %d\n", stats.WriteBytes)
}
```

In this example, we create a new `DiskStats` struct and set its fields to some example values. We then print out the disk I/O statistics using the `fmt.Printf` function.
