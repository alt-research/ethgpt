Certainly, I can help you with that! Here's an example of how you could document the code you provided in Markdown format:

## Metrics Package

The `metrics` package provides functionality for collecting and reporting metrics.

### Functions

#### `ExampleGraphite()`

This function provides an example of how to use the `Graphite` function to report metrics to a Graphite server. It takes no parameters.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you could use the `ExampleGraphite` function in your Go code:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/rcrowley/go-metrics"
    "github.com/rcrowley/go-metrics/graphite"
    "net"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new registry
    registry := metrics.NewRegistry()

    // Register some metrics
    counter := metrics.NewCounter()
    registry.Register("my_counter", counter)

    // Report metrics to a Graphite server
    addr, _ := net.ResolveTCPAddr("net", ":2003")
    go graphite.Graphite(registry, 1*time.Second, "my.prefix", addr)

    // Increment the counter
    counter.Inc(1)

    // Wait for some time to allow metrics to be reported
    time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
}
```

In this example, we create a new registry and register a counter metric. We then use the `Graphite` function to report metrics to a Graphite server. We increment the counter and wait for some time to allow metrics to be reported.

#### `ExampleGraphiteWithConfig()`

This function provides an example of how to use the `GraphiteWithConfig` function to report metrics to a Graphite server with a custom configuration. It takes no parameters.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you could use the `ExampleGraphiteWithConfig` function in your Go code:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/rcrowley/go-metrics"
    "github.com/rcrowley/go-metrics/graphite"
    "net"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new registry
    registry := metrics.NewRegistry()

    // Register some metrics
    counter := metrics.NewCounter()
    registry.Register("my_counter", counter)

    // Report metrics to a Graphite server with a custom configuration
    addr, _ := net.ResolveTCPAddr("net", ":2003")
    config := graphite.GraphiteConfig{
        Addr:          addr,
        Registry:      registry,
        FlushInterval: 1 * time.Second,
        DurationUnit:  time.Millisecond,
        Percentiles:   []float64{0.5, 0.75, 0.99, 0.999},
    }
    go graphite.GraphiteWithConfig(config)

    // Increment the counter
    counter.Inc(1)

    // Wait for some time to allow metrics to be reported
    time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
}
```

In this example, we create a new registry and register a counter metric. We then use the `GraphiteWithConfig` function to report metrics to a Graphite server with a custom configuration. We increment the counter and wait for some time to allow metrics to be reported.
