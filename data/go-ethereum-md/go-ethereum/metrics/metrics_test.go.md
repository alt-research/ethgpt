Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's an example of how you could document the code you provided in Markdown format:

## Metrics Package

The `metrics` package provides a way to collect and report various metrics from your Go application.

### Functions

#### `TestReadRuntimeValues(t *testing.T)`

This function is used to test the `readRuntimeStats` function, which reads various runtime statistics and stores them in a `runtimeStats` struct.

#### `BenchmarkMetrics(b *testing.B)`

This function is used to benchmark the various metrics provided by the `metrics` package. It creates a new registry, registers various counters, gauges, histograms, meters, and timers, and then updates them in a loop. It also captures debug GC stats and writes the metrics to an output stream. The function takes one parameter:

- `b` (*testing.B): The testing benchmark object.

#### `Example()`

This function provides an example of how to use the `metrics` package. It creates a new counter, registers it with the name "money", increments it by 17, creates a new timer, registers it with the name "db.get.latency", times a function call with a 10 millisecond sleep, updates the timer with a value of 1, and then prints the count of the counter and the minimum value of the timer.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you could use the `metrics` package in your Go code:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"

    "github.com/rcrowley/go-metrics"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new counter
    c := metrics.NewCounter()
    // Register the counter with the name "requests"
    metrics.Register("requests", c)
    // Increment the counter by 1
    c.Inc(1)

    // Create a new timer
    t := metrics.NewTimer()
    // Register the timer with the name "latency"
    metrics.Register("latency", t)
    // Time a function call with a 10 millisecond sleep
    t.Time(func() { time.Sleep(10 * time.Millisecond) })
    // Update the timer with a value of 1
    t.Update(1)

    // Print the count of the counter and the minimum value of the timer
    fmt.Println("Count:", c.Count())
    fmt.Println("Min:", t.Min())
}
```

In this example, we create a new counter and timer, register them with the names "requests" and "latency", respectively, increment the counter by 1, time a function call with a 10 millisecond sleep, update the timer with a value of 1, and then print the count of the counter and the minimum value of the timer.
