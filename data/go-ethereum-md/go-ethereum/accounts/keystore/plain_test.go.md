## KeyStore Package

The `keystore` package provides functionality for managing Ethereum accounts and their associated private keys. It defines two types of key stores: `keyStorePlain` and `keyStorePassphrase`. The former stores private keys in plain text, while the latter encrypts them with a passphrase.

### Functions

- `tmpKeyStoreIface(t *testing.T, encrypted bool)`: creates a temporary key store interface for testing purposes. The `encrypted` parameter specifies whether the key store should be encrypted with a passphrase or not.
- `storeNewKey(ks keyStore, rand io.Reader, auth string) (*Key, *accounts.Account, error)`: generates a new private key and stores it in the specified key store. Returns the generated key and the associated account.
- `importPreSaleKey(ks keyStore, keyJSON []byte, auth string) (*accounts.Account, []byte, error)`: imports a pre-sale key into the specified key store. Returns the imported account and the associated private key.

### Types

- `keyStore`: interface defining the methods that a key store must implement.
- `keyStorePlain`: implementation of the `keyStore` interface that stores private keys in plain text.
- `keyStorePassphrase`: implementation of the `keyStore` interface that encrypts private keys with a passphrase.
- `Key`: struct representing an Ethereum private key.
- `encryptedKeyJSONV3`: struct representing an encrypted Ethereum key in JSON format.

### Tests

The `keystore` package includes several tests to ensure the correct functionality of the key store implementations. These tests cover the creation of new keys, importing pre-sale keys, and retrieving keys from the ## KeyStore Package

The `KeyStore` package provides functionality for managing encrypted Ethereum key files. It includes functions for encrypting and decrypting private keys, as well as for generating new keys.

### Types

- `encryptedKeyJSONV1`: represents the JSON format for encrypted keys in version 1 of the key store.
- `KeyStoreTestV3`: represents a test case for version 3 of the key store.
- `KeyStoreTestV1`: represents a test case for version 1 of the key store.
- `keyStorePassphrase`: represents a key store with a passphrase.

### Functions

- `TestV3_PBKDF2_1`: tests the decryption of a key using version 3 of the key store with PBKDF2.
- `skipIfSubmoduleMissing`: skips a test if the JSON test submodule is missing.
- `TestV3_PBKDF2_2`: tests the decryption of a key using version 3 of the key store with PBKDF2.
- `TestV3_PBKDF2_3`: tests the decryption of a key using version 3 of the key store with PBKDF2.
- `TestV3_PBKDF2_4`: tests the decryption of a key using version 3 of the key store with PBKDF2.
- `TestV3_Scrypt_1`: tests the decryption of a key using version 3 of the key store with ## Test Functions

The `TestV3_31_Byte_Key` and `TestV3_30_Byte_Key` functions are test functions for the `loadKeyStoreTestV3` and `testDecryptV3` functions. They are used to test the functionality of the `KeyStore` and `DecryptKey` methods for V3 key stores.

The `TestV3_31_Byte_Key` function loads a V3 key store test vector from a JSON file and tests the `KeyStore` method with a 31-byte key. The `testDecryptV3` function is called with the test vector and the testing object.

The `TestV3_30_Byte_Key` function loads a V3 key store test vector from a JSON file and tests the `DecryptKey` method with a 30-byte key. The `testDecryptV3` function is called with the test vector and the testing object.

Both functions are marked as `Parallel` to allow them to run concurrently with other test functions.
