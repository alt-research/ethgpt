## Runtime Package Documentation

The `runtime` package provides functionality for executing Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode. It includes methods for parsing, validating, and executing EVM bytecode.

### Fuzz

The `Fuzz` function is the basic entry point for the go-fuzz tool. It takes a byte slice as input and returns an integer. It calls the `Execute` function from the `runtime` package with the input byte slice as the code, the input byte slice as the input data, and a `Config` struct with a gas limit of 12000000. If there is an error during execution and the error message starts with "invalid", it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns 1.
