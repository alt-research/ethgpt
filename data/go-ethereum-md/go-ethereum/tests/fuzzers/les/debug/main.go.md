# Go Ethereum Library - Debugging Tool

This source code file implements a debugging tool for the Light Ethereum Subprotocol (LES) in the Go Ethereum library. The tool is designed to help developers identify and fix bugs in the LES protocol by running a fuzzer on a crasher file.

## Functions

### `main()`

The `main()` function is the entry point for the debugging tool. It takes a single command-line argument, which is the path to the crasher file to be debugged. If the argument is missing or incorrect, the function prints a usage message and exits with an error code.

If the argument is valid, the function reads the contents of the crasher file into memory and passes it to the `les.Fuzz()` function, which runs the fuzzer on the data. If the fuzzer detects a bug in the LES protocol, it will print an error message and exit with an error code.

## Dependencies

The debugging tool depends on the `os` and `fmt` packages from the Go standard library, as well as the `les` package from the Go Ethereum library. The `les` package provides the `Fuzz()` function, which is used to run the fuzzer on the crasher data.
