# Main Package

The `main` package is a part of the `go-ethereum` library, which is a free and open-source blockchain software project. This package provides a simple command-line interface for running the `Fuzz` function from the `difficulty` package.

## Main Function

The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It takes a single command-line argument, which is the path to a file containing input data for the `Fuzz` function. The function reads the input data from the file and passes it to the `Fuzz` function.

## Crasher Variable

The `crasher` variable is a string that represents the path to the input data file. It is set to the first command-line argument.

## Data Variable

The `data` variable is a byte slice that represents the input data for the `Fuzz` function. It is read from the input data file using the `os.ReadFile` function.

## Error Handling

The `main` function performs error handling for the following scenarios:

- If the program is not given exactly one command-line argument, it prints an error message to `os.Stderr` and exits with a status code of 1.
- If there is an error reading the input data file, it prints an error message to `os.Stderr` and exits with a status code of 1.

## Conclusion

The `main` package provides a simple command-line interface for running the `Fuzz` function from the `difficulty` package. It takes a single command-line argument, which is the path to a file containing input data for the `Fuzz` function. The package includes error handling for scenarios where the program is not given exactly one command-line argument or there is an error reading the input data file.
