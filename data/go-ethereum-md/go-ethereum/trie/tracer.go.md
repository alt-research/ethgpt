The code provided is a Go implementation of a tracer for tracking changes to trie nodes. The trie is a data structure used to store key-value pairs, where the keys are byte arrays and the values are arbitrary byte arrays. The tracer is used to track changes to the trie nodes during trie operations, such as insertions and deletions. The tracer is an auxiliary tool used to capture all deleted nodes that are not captured by the trie.Hasher or trie.Committer.

The following is a description of each function in the code:

- `newTracer() *tracer`: This function initializes a new tracer instance for capturing trie changes. It returns a pointer to the tracer instance.

- `onRead(path []byte, val []byte)`: This function tracks the newly loaded trie node and caches the RLP-encoded blob internally. The function takes the path and value of the node as input parameters.

- `onInsert(path []byte)`: This function tracks the newly inserted trie node. If the node is already in the deletion set (resurrected node), then it is removed from the deletion set as it is "untouched". The function takes the path of the node as an input parameter.

- `onDelete(path []byte)`: This function tracks the newly deleted trie node. If the node is already in the addition set, then it is removed from the addition set as it is "untouched". The function takes the path of the node as an input parameter.

- `reset()`: This function clears the content tracked by the tracer.

- `copy() *tracer`: This function returns a deep copied tracer instance.

The tracer is not thread-safe, so callers should be responsible for handling the concurrency issues by themselves.

The tracer is used in the trie package to track changes to trie nodes during trie operations. The trie package is part of the go-ethereum library, which is a free and open-source library for building decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. The go-ethereum library is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. The code provided is a Go implementation of a tracer data structure used in a file system. The tracer is used to track changes to the file system, such as file creations, deletions, and modifications. The tracer is implemented as a struct with three fields: `inserts`, `deletes`, and `accessList`. The `inserts` field is a map of file paths to file contents that have been inserted into the file system. The `deletes` field is a set of file paths that have been deleted from the file system. The `accessList` field is a map of file paths to file contents that have been accessed in the file system.

The following is a description of each function in the code:

- `newTracer() *tracer`: This function creates a new tracer with empty `inserts`, `deletes`, and `accessList` fields.

- `addInsert(path string, blob []byte)`: This function adds an insert operation to the tracer. The `path` parameter is the path of the file being inserted, and the `blob` parameter is the contents of the file being inserted.

- `addDelete(path string)`: This function adds a delete operation to the tracer. The `path` parameter is the path of the file being deleted.

- `addAccess(path string, blob []byte)`: This function adds an access operation to the tracer. The `path` parameter is the path of the file being accessed, and the `blob` parameter is the contents of the file being accessed.

- `copy() *tracer`: This function creates a copy of the tracer. The copy includes all the `inserts`, `deletes`, and `accessList` fields.

- `markDeletions(set *NodeSet)`: This function marks all tracked deletions in the provided `NodeSet`. The `NodeSet` is a data structure used to represent the file system. The function iterates over all the file paths in the `deletes` field and marks them as deleted in the `NodeSet`. If a file path is not in the `accessList` of the `NodeSet`, it is filtered out.

Here is an example of how to use the tracer:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	tracer := newTracer()

	tracer.addInsert("/foo", []byte("bar"))
	tracer.addDelete("/baz")
	tracer.addAccess("/foo", []byte("bar"))

	copy := tracer.copy()

	fmt.Println(tracer)
	fmt.Println(copy)

	nodeSet := NewNodeSet()
	nodeSet.Insert([]byte("/foo"), []byte("baz"))
	nodeSet.Insert([]byte("/baz"), []byte("qux"))

	tracer.markDeletions(nodeSet)

	fmt.Println(nodeSet)
}
```

In this example, we create a new tracer and add an insert, delete, and access operation to it. We then create a copy of the tracer and print both the original and the copy. Finally, we create a `NodeSet` representing the file system and insert two files into it. We then call the `markDeletions` function on the tracer, passing in the `NodeSet`. The `markDeletions` function marks all the tracked deletions in the `NodeSet`. We print the `NodeSet` to verify that the deletions have been marked.
