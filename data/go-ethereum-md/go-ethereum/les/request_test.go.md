This is a Go source code file that belongs to the go-ethereum library. The file contains test functions for the LES (Light Ethereum Subprotocol) package. The LES package is responsible for providing a light client implementation of the Ethereum protocol. The test functions are used to test the functionality of the LES package.

The file starts with a license header that specifies the terms under which the go-ethereum library is distributed. The library is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 or later.

The file imports several packages from the go-ethereum library, including "common", "core/rawdb", "crypto", "ethdb", and "light". It also imports the "context" and "testing" packages from the Go standard library.

The file defines a function called "secAddr" that takes a common.Address parameter and returns a byte slice. The function uses the Keccak256 hash function from the crypto package to compute the hash of the address and returns the result as a byte slice.

The file defines several test functions that test different aspects of the LES package. Each test function takes a database, a block hash, and a block number as parameters and returns an OdrRequest object. The OdrRequest object is used to request data from a light client node.

The test functions use the "testAccess" function to test the functionality of the LES package. The "testAccess" function takes a testing.T object, a protocol version, and an accessTestFn function as parameters. The accessTestFn function is used to generate an OdrRequest object that is used to request data from a light client node.

The test functions are named according to the type of data they request. For example, the "TestBlockAccessLes2" function tests the functionality of the LES package when requesting block data for protocol version 2.

The file ends with a call to the "newClientServerEnv" function, which sets up a test environment for the LES package. The test environment includes a server and a client node that communicate with each other to test the functionality of the LES package. The `CurrentHeader()` function is a method of the `blockchain` struct in the `ler.backend.blockchain` package. It returns the current header of the blockchain. 

The code block you provided is a test function that checks if the chain is synced with the server. It takes an argument `expFail` which is the expected block number at which the object retrieval should fail. 

The `test()` function iterates through the blocks in the blockchain up to the current block number and retrieves objects from the client's database using the `fn()` function. It then creates a context with a timeout of 200 milliseconds and attempts to retrieve the object from the server using the `odr.Retrieve()` function. 

If the retrieval is successful, it checks if the block number is less than the expected failure block number. If it is, it fails the test with an error message indicating that the object retrieval failed. If the retrieval is unsuccessful, it checks if the block number is greater than or equal to the expected failure block number. If it is, it fails the test with an error message indicating that the object retrieval succeeded unexpectedly.

Here's an example of how you could document this code in Markdown format:

## `CurrentHeader()`

```go
func (b *blockchain) CurrentHeader() *types.Header
```

Returns the current header of the blockchain.

## `test(expFail uint64)`

```go
func test(expFail uint64)
```

The `test()` function is a test function that checks if the chain is synced with the server. It takes an argument `expFail` which is the expected block number at which the object retrieval should fail. 

### Parameters

- `expFail uint64`: The expected block number at which the object retrieval should fail.

### Example

```go
test(5)
```

The `test()` function iterates through the blocks in the blockchain up to the current block number and retrieves objects from the client's database using the `fn()` function. It then creates a context with a timeout of 200 milliseconds and attempts to retrieve the object from the server using the `odr.Retrieve()` function. 

If the retrieval is successful, it checks if the block number is less than the expected failure block number. If it is, it fails the test with an error message indicating that the object retrieval failed. If the retrieval is unsuccessful, it checks if the block number is greater than or equal to the expected failure block number. If it is, it fails the test with an error message indicating that the object retrieval succeeded unexpectedly.
