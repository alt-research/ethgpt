Package checkpointoracle is a wrapper of checkpoint oracle contract with additional rules defined. This package can be used both in LES client or server side for offering oracle related APIs.

The CheckpointOracle struct is responsible for offering the latest stable checkpoint generated and announced by the contract admins on-chain. The checkpoint can be verified by clients locally during the checkpoint syncing.

The New function creates a checkpoint oracle handler with given configs and callback.

The Start function binds the contract backend, initializes the oracle instance and marks the status as available.

The IsRunning function returns an indicator whether the oracle is running.

The Contract function returns the underlying raw checkpoint oracle contract.

The StableCheckpoint function returns the stable checkpoint which was generated by local indexers and announced by trusted signers. The code provided is a part of a CheckpointOracle struct in a Go program. The CheckpointOracle is responsible for verifying and retrieving the latest checkpoint from a contract on the blockchain. The code contains two functions, GetLatestCheckpoint and VerifySigners.

The GetLatestCheckpoint function retrieves the latest checkpoint from the contract and returns it along with the height of the checkpoint. If the latest checkpoint is not found or is empty, the function returns nil and 0. The function first checks if the local node has the latest checkpoint. If it does, the function returns the checkpoint and its height. If the local checkpoint does not match the registered one, the function returns nil and 0.

The VerifySigners function is responsible for verifying the signatures of the checkpoint and checking if there are enough approvals to finalize the checkpoint. The function takes in the index of the checkpoint, the hash of the checkpoint, and the signatures of the checkpoint. If the number of signatures is less than the threshold, the function returns false and nil. The function then recovers the signer addresses according to the signature and checks if there are enough approvals to finalize the checkpoint. If there are enough approvals, the function returns true and the signer addresses. If there are not enough approvals, the function returns false and nil.

Here is an example of how to use the GetLatestCheckpoint function:

```
oracle := CheckpointOracle{}
checkpoint, height := oracle.GetLatestCheckpoint()
if checkpoint == nil {
    fmt.Println("No checkpoint found")
} else {
    fmt.Println("Latest checkpoint:", checkpoint)
    fmt.Println("Height of checkpoint:", height)
}
```

Here is an example of how to use the VerifySigners function:

```
oracle := CheckpointOracle{}
index := uint64(1)
hash := [32]byte{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32}
signatures := [][]byte{{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65}}
approved, signers := oracle.VerifySigners(index, hash, signatures)
if approved {
    fmt.Println("Checkpoint approved by signers:", signers)
} else {
    fmt.Println("Checkpoint not approved")
}
```
