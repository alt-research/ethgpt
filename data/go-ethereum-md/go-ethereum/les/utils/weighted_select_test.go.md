# Weighted Random Select

The `WeightedRandomSelect` package provides a function to randomly select an item from a list based on a weight function. The weight function is used to assign a weight to each item in the list, and the function selects an item with a probability proportional to its weight.

## Functions

### `testWeight(i interface{}) uint64`

This function is used to assign a weight to each item in the list. It takes an interface as input and returns a uint64 value representing the weight of the item. In this implementation, the weight is simply the index of the item plus one.

### `TestWeightedRandomSelect(t *testing.T)`

This function is a test function that tests the `WeightedRandomSelect` package. It creates a list of `testWrsItem` structs, each with a unique index and a pointer to a weight index. It then creates a `WeightedRandomSelect` object and updates it with each item in the list. It randomly selects an item from the list based on the weight function and checks that the selected item is the expected item. It also checks that selecting an item with an invalid weight index returns nil.

## Types

### `testWrsItem`

This struct represents an item in the list. It has an index and a pointer to a weight index.
