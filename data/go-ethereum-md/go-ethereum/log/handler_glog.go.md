The `GlogHandler` is a log handler that provides filtering features similar to Google's glog logger. It allows setting global log levels, overriding with callsite pattern matches, and requesting backtraces at certain positions. 

The `NewGlogHandler` function creates a new log handler with filtering functionality similar to Google's glog logger. It takes a `Handler` as an argument and returns a pointer to a `GlogHandler`.

The `SetHandler` method updates the handler to write records to the specified sub-handler.

The `Verbosity` method sets the glog verbosity ceiling. The verbosity of individual packages and source files can be raised using `Vmodule`.

The `Vmodule` method sets the glog verbosity pattern. The syntax of the argument is a comma-separated list of pattern=N, where the pattern is a literal file name or "glob" pattern matching and N is a V level.

The `pattern` struct contains a filter for the Vmodule option, holding a verbosity level and a file pattern to match.

The `errVmoduleSyntax` variable is returned when a user vmodule pattern is invalid.

The `errTraceSyntax` variable is returned when a user backtrace pattern is invalid.

Here is an example usage of the `GlogHandler`:

```
import (
    "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/log"
)

func main() {
    handler := log.NewGlogHandler(log.StdoutHandler())
    handler.Verbosity(log.LvlInfo)
    handler.Vmodule("gopher.go=3")
    logger := log.New()
    logger.SetHandler(handler)
    logger.Info("Hello, world!")
}
``` ## GlogHandler Source Code Documentation

The `GlogHandler` struct is a custom logging handler that implements the `Handler` interface. It provides additional functionality to filter log records based on global, local, and backtrace filters.

### Vmodule

The `Vmodule` function sets the local filter rules for the `GlogHandler`. It takes a string argument that contains a comma-separated list of filter rules. Each filter rule consists of a pattern and a logging level separated by an equal sign. The pattern is a regular expression that matches the log message's file path, and the logging level is an integer value that determines the minimum logging level for the matched log messages.

If the pattern does not end with ".go", the function appends "/[^/]+\\.go" to the pattern to match only Go source files. The function compiles the pattern into a regular expression and appends it to the local filter rules.

### BacktraceAt

The `BacktraceAt` function sets the backtrace location for the `GlogHandler`. It takes a string argument that contains the file path and line number of a logging statement. The file path must end with ".go", and the line number must be a valid integer value. When the logging statement is executed, the `GlogHandler` writes a stack trace to the Info log.

### Log

The `Log` function filters a log record through the global, local, and backtrace filters and emits it if either allow it through. It takes a pointer to a `Record` struct that contains the log message's details, such as the logging level, file path, line number, and message.

If the backtrace location is set, the function checks whether the log message's callsite matches the backtrace location. If it matches, the function raises the logging level to Info and gathers the stacks.

If the global log level allows the log message's logging level, the function fast-tracks logging and emits the log message.

If no local overrides are present, the function fast-tracks skipping the log message.

If the log message's callsite is not cached, the function calculates the log level based on the local filter rules and caches it. If the log level is greater than or equal to the log message's logging level, the function emits the log message.

### Example Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/golang/glog"
)

func main() {
	// Set the global log level to Info
	glog.V(0).Info("Starting application")

	// Set the local filter rule to match all files in the "pkg" directory with a logging level of 2
	glog.V(2).Vmodule("pkg/*=2")

	// Set the backtrace location to the logging statement in "main.go" at line 10
	glog.BacktraceAt("main.go:10")

	// Log a message with a logging level of Error
	glog.Error("An error occurred")

	// Log a message with a logging level of Info
	glog.Info("Application started")

	// Flush the log buffer and close the log file
	glog.Flush()
}
