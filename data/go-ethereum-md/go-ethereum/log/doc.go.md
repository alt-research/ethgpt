The log15 package provides a simple and opinionated toolkit for logging that is both human and machine-readable. It is modeled after the standard library's io and net/http packages. This package enforces logging only key/value pairs, where keys must be strings and values can be any type. The default output format is logfmt, but JSON can also be used. 

To get started with log15, import the library using `import log "github.com/inconshreveable/log15"`. Then, you can start logging using `log.Info("Program starting", "args", os.Args())`. The first argument to every logging method is the value to the implicit key 'msg'. The level you choose for a message will be automatically added with the key 'lvl', and so will the current timestamp with key 't'. You may supply any additional context as a set of key/value pairs to the logging function. 

If you want to add context to a logger, you can create new loggers that have context that is automatically included with each log line. For example, `requestlogger := log.New("path", r.URL.Path)` creates a new logger with the context of the path. Later, you can log using `requestlogger.Debug("db txn commit", "duration", txnTimer.Finish())`.

Handlers define where log lines are printed to and how they are formatted. The Handler interface is defined as `type Handler interface { Log(r *Record) error }`. Handlers can filter records, format them, or dispatch to multiple other Handlers. This package implements a number of Handlers for common logging patterns that are easily composed to create flexible, custom logging structures. 

There are three Handlers that add debugging information to the context: CallerFileHandler, CallerFuncHandler, and CallerStackHandler. For example, `h := log.CallerFileHandler(log.StdoutHandler())` adds the source file and line number of each logging call to the context. 

Here is an example of a handler that prints logfmt output to Stdout: `handler := log.StreamHandler(os.Stdout, log.LogfmtFormat())`. Here is an example of a handler that defers to two other handlers: `handler := log.MultiHandler(log.LvlFilterHandler(log.LvlError, log.Must.FileHandler("/var/log/service.json", log.JSONFormat())), log.MatchFilterHandler("pkg", "app/rpc", log.StdoutHandler()))`. 

Overall, log15 provides a simple and flexible way to log key/value pairs with context and debugging information. of formatting is designed to be more human-readable and colorful, making it easier to quickly scan logs for important information. Here's an example of what a log message might look like in TerminalFormat:

	[INFO] 2021-09-01T14:30:00-0700 myapp/main.go: Starting up...

As you can see, the log level is displayed in brackets, followed by the timestamp, the name of the source file, and finally the log message itself. This format can be customized by creating a new TerminalFormat object and passing it to the handler:

	termFormat := log.TerminalFormat()
	termFormat.Colors["info"] = log.Cyan
	termFormat.Colors["error"] = log.Red
	h := log.StreamHandler(os.Stdout, termFormat)

In this example, we're creating a new TerminalFormat object and then customizing the colors for the "info" and "error" log levels. We then create a new StreamHandler that writes to stdout and use our custom TerminalFormat object as the formatter.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the log15 package provides a powerful and flexible logging framework for Go applications. With its simple interface and support for custom handlers and formatters, it's easy to integrate into any project and customize to your specific needs. By following the best practices outlined in this documentation, you can ensure that your logs are informative, easy to read, and provide valuable insights into the behavior of your application. Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's a Markdown documentation for the `at` function:

## at

The `at` function logs records nicely for your terminal, including color-coded output based on log level.

### Error Handling

Because `log15` allows you to step around the type system, there are a few ways you can specify invalid arguments to the logging functions. You could, for example, wrap something that is not a zero-argument function with `log.Lazy` or pass a context key that is not a string. Since logging libraries are typically the mechanism by which errors are reported, it would be onerous for the logging functions to return errors. Instead, `log15` handles errors by making these guarantees to you:

- Any log record containing an error will still be printed with the error explained to you as part of the log record.

- Any log record containing an error will include the context key `LOG15_ERROR`, enabling you to easily (and if you like, automatically) detect if any of your logging calls are passing bad values.

Understanding this, you might wonder why the `Handler` interface can return an error value in its `Log` method. Handlers are encouraged to return errors only if they fail to write their log records out to an external source like if the syslog daemon is not responding. This allows the construction of useful handlers which cope with those failures like the `FailoverHandler`.

### Library Use

`log15` is intended to be useful for library authors as a way to provide configurable logging to users of their library. Best practice for use in a library is to always disable all output for your logger by default and to provide a public `Logger` instance that consumers of your library can configure. Like so:

```go
package yourlib

import "github.com/inconshreveable/log15"

var Log = log.New()

func init() {
    Log.SetHandler(log.DiscardHandler())
}
```

Users of your library may then enable it if they like:

```go
import "github.com/inconshreveable/log15"
import "example.com/yourlib"

func main() {
    handler := // custom handler setup
    yourlib.Log.SetHandler(handler)
}
```

### Best practices attaching logger context

The ability to attach context to a logger is a powerful one. Where should you do it and why? I favor embedding a `Logger` directly into any persistent object in my application and adding unique, tracing context keys to it. For instance, imagine I am writing a web browser:

```go
type Tab struct {
    url string
    render *RenderingContext
    // ...

    Logger
}

func NewTab(url string) *Tab {
    return &Tab {
        // ...
        url: url,

        Logger: log.New("url", url),
    }
}
```

When a new tab is created, I assign a logger to it with the url of the tab as context so it can easily be traced through the logs. Now, whenever we perform any operation with the tab, we'll log with its embedded logger and it will include the tab title automatically:

```go
tab.Debug("moved position", "idx", tab.idx)
```

There's only one problem. What if the tab url changes? We could use `log.Lazy` to make sure the current url is always written, but that would mean that we couldn't trace a tab's full lifetime through our logs after the user navigate to a new URL.

Instead, think about what values to attach to your loggers the same way you think about what to use as a key in a SQL database schema. If it's possible to use a natural key that is unique for the lifetime of the object, do so. But otherwise, `log15`'s `ext` package has a handy `RandId` function to let you generate what you might call "surrogate keys". They're just random hex identifiers to use for tracing. Back to our Tab example, we would prefer to set up our `Logger` like so:

```go
import logext "github.com/inconshreveable/log15/ext"

t := &Tab {
    // ...
    url: url,
}

t.Logger = log.New("id", logext.RandId(8), "url", lo
``` 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with. ## Introduction

The code snippet provided is a part of a Go package named `log`. This package provides a logging infrastructure for Go programs. The package is designed to be easy to use yet flexible and extensible. The package provides a simple API for logging messages at different levels of severity, and it supports multiple output formats and destinations.

## Code Explanation

The code snippet provided is a part of the `Tab` struct's `Lazy` method. The `Lazy` method takes a function as an argument and returns the `Tab` object. The function passed as an argument is executed lazily when the `Tab` object is used for the first time.

```go
g.Lazy{t.getUrl})
	return t
```

Here, `g` is an instance of the `Group` struct, and `t` is an instance of the `Tab` struct. The `getUrl` method of the `Tab` struct is passed as an argument to the `Lazy` method of the `Group` struct. The `getUrl` method returns the current URL of the `Tab` object.

The purpose of this code is to generate a unique traceable identifier for the `Tab` object, even when new URLs are loaded. This is achieved by executing the `getUrl` method lazily when the `Tab` object is used for the first time.

## Must

The `Must` object provides a version of the Handler functions that can return an error but panics on failure. This is useful when the program cannot continue without the Handler function succeeding. The `Must` object provides a simple API for handling errors in a concise and readable way.

```go
log.Must.FileHandler("/path", log.JSONFormat)
log.Must.NetHandler("tcp", ":1234", log.JSONFormat)
```

Here, `FileHandler` and `NetHandler` are Handler functions that can return an error. The `Must` object provides a version of these functions that panics on failure. The `JSONFormat` argument specifies the output format for the log messages.

## Inspiration and Credit

The `log` package is inspired by several other excellent logging packages, including:

- `log4go` (code.google.com/p/log4go)
- `go-logging` (github.com/op/go-logging)
- `grohl` (github.com/technoweenie/grohl)
- `logrus` (github.com/Sirupsen/logrus)
- `logfmt` (github.com/kr/logfmt)
- `spacelog` (github.com/spacemonkeygo/spacelog)
- Go's standard library, notably `io` and `net/http`

## The Name

The name of the `log` package is inspired by the famous xkcd comic strip about standards (https://xkcd.com/927/). The comic strip humorously illustrates the difficulty of agreeing on a standard, and the `log` package is an attempt to provide a simple and flexible logging infrastructure that can be used across different projects and teams.
