The `log` package provides a flexible logging framework for Go applications. It defines a `Handler` interface that specifies how log records are written, and provides several built-in handlers that can be used to write log records to different destinations.

The `Handler` interface has a single method, `Log`, which takes a `Record` struct and returns an error. The `Record` struct contains information about the log message, such as the message itself, the log level, and any additional context.

The `FuncHandler` function returns a `Handler` that logs records with the given function. This can be useful for creating custom handlers that perform specific actions when a log message is received.

The `StreamHandler` function returns a `Handler` that writes log records to an `io.Writer` with the given format. It wraps itself with `LazyHandler` and `SyncHandler` to evaluate lazy objects and perform safe concurrent writes.

The `SyncHandler` function can be wrapped around a handler to guarantee that only a single `Log` operation can proceed at a time. This is necessary for thread-safe concurrent writes.

The `FileHandler` function returns a handler which writes log records to the given file using the given format. If the file already exists, `FileHandler` will append to the file. If it does not, `FileHandler` will create the file with mode 0644.

The `NetHandler` function opens a socket to the given address and writes records over the connection.

The `CallerFileHandler` function returns a `Handler` that adds the line number and file of the calling function to the context with key "caller".

The `CallerFuncHandler` function returns a `Handler` that adds the calling function name to the context with key "fn".

The `CallerStackHandler` function returns a `Handler` that adds a stack trace to the context with key "stack". The stack trace is formatted as a space separated list of call sites inside matching []'s. The most recent call site is listed first. Each call site is formatted according to the given format.

Here is an example usage of the `StreamHandler` function:

```go
package main

import (
	"os"

	"github.com/pkg/log"
)

func main() {
	handler := log.StreamHandler(os.Stdout, log.JSONFormat{})
	logger := log.NewLogger(handler)

	logger.Info("Hello, world!")
}
```

This will write a log message to standard output in JSON format. This codebase contains a set of functions that are used to handle logging in Go applications. Each function is designed to perform a specific task related to logging, such as filtering log records based on certain criteria or writing log records to multiple locations.

The `Handler` type is defined as an interface that specifies a single method, `Log`, which takes a `*Record` as input and returns an error. This allows for different types of handlers to be created that can handle log records in different ways.

The `FuncHandler` function is a helper function that takes a function that matches the `Handler` interface and returns a `Handler`. This is useful for creating handlers that perform a specific action on a log record before passing it on to another handler.

The `StackHandler` function takes a `Handler` as input and returns a new `Handler` that adds a stack trace to the log record's context. This can be useful for debugging purposes.

The `FilterHandler` function takes a function that evaluates a log record and returns a boolean value, and a `Handler` as input. It returns a new `Handler` that only writes log records to the wrapped `Handler` if the given function evaluates to true.

The `MatchFilterHandler` function takes a key and a value, and a `Handler` as input. It returns a new `Handler` that only writes log records to the wrapped `Handler` if the given key in the logged context matches the value.

The `LvlFilterHandler` function takes a maximum verbosity level and a `Handler` as input. It returns a new `Handler` that only writes log records which are less than the given verbosity level to the wrapped `Handler`.

The `MultiHandler` function takes one or more `Handler`s as input and returns a new `Handler` that dispatches any write to each of its handlers. This is useful for writing different types of log information to different locations.

The `FailoverHandler` function takes one or more `Handler`s as input and returns a new `Handler` that writes all log records to the first handler specified, but will failover and write to the second handler if the first handler has failed, and so on for all handlers specified.

The `ChannelHandler` function takes a channel of `*Record`s as input and returns a new `Handler` that writes all log records to the given channel. It blocks if the channel is full, making it useful for async processing of log messages. The codebase contains several functions that are used to create different types of log handlers. Here is a brief description of each function:

1. `BufferedHandler`: This function creates a buffered log handler that writes all records to a buffered channel of the given size. The buffered channel flushes into the wrapped handler whenever it is available for writing. Since these writes happen asynchronously, all writes to a BufferedHandler never return an error and any errors from the wrapped handler are ignored.

2. `LazyHandler`: This function creates a lazy log handler that writes all values to the wrapped handler after evaluating any lazy functions in the record's context. It is already wrapped around StreamHandler and SyslogHandler in this library, you'll only need it if you write your own Handler.

3. `evaluateLazy`: This function is used by the `LazyHandler` to evaluate a lazy function and return its result. It takes a `Lazy` struct as input and returns an interface and an error.

4. `DiscardHandler`: This function creates a log handler that reports success for all writes but does nothing. It is useful for dynamically disabling logging at runtime via a Logger's SetHandler method.

5. `Must`: This struct provides the following Handler creation functions which instead of returning an error parameter only return a Handler and panic on failure: FileHandler, NetHandler, SyslogHandler, SyslogNetHandler.

6. `must`: This function is used by the `Must` struct to panic on failure and return a Handler.

Each function has a clear and concise description of its purpose and usage. Additionally, the codebase uses Go's built-in documentation format to provide further explanation of each function and its parameters.
