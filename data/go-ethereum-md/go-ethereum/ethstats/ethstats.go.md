# Ethstats Documentation

## Introduction

The `ethstats` package implements the network stats reporting service for Ethereum. It provides a daemon that pushes local chain statistics up to a monitoring server. The package is part of the `go-ethereum` library and is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

## Backend Interface

The `backend` interface encompasses the bare-minimum functionality needed for ethstats reporting. It defines the following methods:

- `SubscribeChainHeadEvent(ch chan<- core.ChainHeadEvent) event.Subscription`: Subscribes to the chain head event and returns a subscription.
- `SubscribeNewTxsEvent(ch chan<- core.NewTxsEvent) event.Subscription`: Subscribes to the new transactions event and returns a subscription.
- `CurrentHeader() *types.Header`: Returns the current header.
- `HeaderByNumber(ctx context.Context, number rpc.BlockNumber) (*types.Header, error)`: Returns the header for the given block number.
- `GetTd(ctx context.Context, hash common.Hash) *big.Int`: Returns the total difficulty for the given block hash.
- `Stats() (pending int, queued int)`: Returns the number of pending and queued transactions.
- `SyncProgress() ethereum.SyncProgress`: Returns the sync progress.

## Full Node Backend Interface

The `fullNodeBackend` interface encompasses the functionality necessary for a full node reporting to ethstats. It extends the `backend` interface and defines the following additional methods:

- `Miner() *miner.Miner`: Returns the ## Documentation for connWrapper

The `connWrapper` struct is a wrapper around a `websocket.Conn` object that provides thread-safe access to the `WriteJSON`, `ReadJSON`, and `Close` methods of the underlying connection. The `rlock` and `wlock` mutexes are used to ensure that only one goroutine can call the read or write methods at a time.

### newConnectionWrapper

```go
func newConnectionWrapper(conn *websocket.Conn) *connWrapper
```

`newConnectionWrapper` creates a new `connWrapper` object with the given `websocket.Conn` object. It sets the read limit of the connection to `messageSizeLimit`.

### WriteJSON

```go
func (w *connWrapper) WriteJSON(v interface{}) error
```

`WriteJSON` is a thread-safe wrapper around the `WriteJSON` method of the underlying `websocket.Conn` object. It acquires the `wlock` mutex before calling the method and releases it afterwards.

### ReadJSON

```go
func (w *connWrapper) ReadJSON(v interface{}) error
```

`ReadJSON` is a thread-safe wrapper around the `ReadJSON` method of the underlying `websocket.Conn` object. It acquires the `rlock` mutex before calling the method The `readLoop` function is a method of the `Service` struct. It is responsible for continuously reading data packets from the network socket as long as the connection is alive. If any of the packets match an active request, it forwards it. If the packets themselves are requests, it initiates a reply. Lastly, it drops unknown packets.

The function takes a single argument, `conn`, which is a pointer to a `connWrapper` struct. The `connWrapper` struct is a wrapper around a `*websocket.Conn` object that provides additional functionality.

The function starts by creating a loop that runs as long as the connection is alive. Within the loop, it reads data packets from the network socket using the `conn.ReadMessage` method. The method returns three values: the message type, the message data, and an ## Documentation for `func readLoop(conn *connWrapper)`

This function is responsible for reading messages from the stats server and processing them. It takes a `connWrapper` object as an argument, which is a wrapper around a WebSocket connection. The function reads a JSON message from the connection and processes it based on its content. If the message is a system ping, it responds to it directly. If the message is a history request, it forwards it to the event processor. If the message is a ping reply, it delivers it to the ping routine. If the message is anything else, it logs it as an unknown stats message.

## Documentation for `type nodeInfo struct`

This is a struct that represents the meta information about a node that is displayed on the monitoring page. It has the following fields:

- `Name`: The name of the node.
- The code is written in Go and is a part of the Ethereum network. It is responsible for reporting various statistics about the node to the Ethereum statistics server. The code contains several functions that are used to report different types of statistics.

The `login` function is used to authenticate the node with the statistics server. It takes a connection object and sends a login message to the server. The message contains information about the node, such as its name, network, and protocol. If the login is successful, the function returns nil, otherwise, it returns an error.

The `report` function is used to report various statistics to the server. It takes a connection object and calls several other functions to report different types of statistics, such as latency, block information, pending transactions, and node statistics. If any of the reporting functions fail, the `report` function returns an error.

The `reportLatency` ## Documentation for the Ethstats Service

The Ethstats Service is a Go package that provides a service for reporting Ethereum blockchain statistics to a stats server. The package contains several functions that are used to gather and report the required statistics.

### Function: r

This function is used to gather the block details from the header or block chain and assemble the block report. The report is then sent to the stats server. The function takes a connection object `conn` as an argument and returns an error if any.

### Function: assembleBlockStats

This function is used to retrieve any required metadata to report a single block and assemble the block stats. If the block is nil, the current head is processed. The function takes a block object `block` as an argument and returns a `blockStats` object.

### Function: reportHistory The code above is written in Go and is part of a service that reports various statistics about a local Ethereum node to a stats server. The service has three functions: `ats`, `reportPending`, and `reportStats`.

The `ats` function takes a `history` parameter and creates a map of statistics to be reported to the stats server. It then sends the map to the server using a WebSocket connection.

The `reportPending` function retrieves the current number of pending transactions from the local blockchain and reports it to the stats server. It creates a map of statistics to be reported, including the number of pending transactions, and sends it to the server using a WebSocket connection.

The `reportStats` function retrieves various statistics about the local node, including whether it is active, syncing, or mining, the hashrate, the number of peers, the gas price, and the uptime. It creates a map of statistics to be reported and sends it to the server using a WebSocket connection.

Each function has a corresponding struct that defines the statistics to be reported. The `pendStats` struct defines the number of pending transactions, while the `nodeStats` struct defines the various statistics about the local node.

Overall, the code is well-structured and follows best practices for Go programming. The functions are well-documented and use clear and concise variable names. The code also includes error handling to ensure that any errors that occur during the reporting process are properly handled.
