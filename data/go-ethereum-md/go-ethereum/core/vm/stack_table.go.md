## Documentation for the `vm` package

### Introduction
The `vm` package is a part of the go-ethereum library, which is a free and open-source software for building decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. The `vm` package provides the virtual machine implementation for executing Ethereum smart contracts.

### Function Documentation

#### `minSwapStack(n int) int`
The `minSwapStack` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the minimum stack size required for executing a `SWAPn` opcode, which swaps the top of the stack with the `n`th item from the top. The function returns an integer value representing the minimum stack size required for executing the opcode.

#### `maxSwapStack(n int) int`
The `maxSwapStack` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the maximum stack size required for executing a `SWAPn` opcode, which swaps the top of the stack with the `n`th item from the top. The function returns an integer value representing the maximum stack size required for executing the opcode.

#### `minDupStack(n int) int`
The `minDupStack` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the minimum stack size required for executing a `DUPn` opcode, which duplicates the `n`th item from the top of the stack. The function returns an integer value representing the minimum stack size required for executing the opcode.

#### `maxDupStack(n int) int`
The `maxDupStack` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the maximum stack size required for executing a `DUPn` opcode, which duplicates the `n`th item from the top of the stack. The function returns an integer value representing the maximum stack size required for executing the opcode.

#### `maxStack(pop, push int) int`
The `maxStack` function takes two integers `pop` and `push` as input and returns the maximum stack size required for executing an opcode that pops `pop` items from the stack and pushes `push` items onto the stack. The function returns an integer value representing the maximum stack size required for executing the opcode.

#### `minStack(pops, push int) int`
The `minStack` function takes two integers `pops` and `push` as input and returns the minimum stack size required for executing an opcode that pops `pops` items from the stack and pushes `push` items onto the stack. The function returns an integer value representing the minimum stack size required for executing the opcode.
