The `state` package provides an implementation of the Ethereum state trie. The state trie is used to store the current state of the Ethereum blockchain, including account balances, contract code, and contract storage.

The `Database` interface defines the methods required to access the state trie and contract code. The `Trie` interface defines the methods required to interact with the state trie.

The `OpenTrie` method opens the main account trie with the given root hash. The `OpenStorageTrie` method opens the storage trie of an account with the given state root hash, account address hash, and storage root hash. The `CopyTrie` method returns an independent copy of the given trie.

The `ContractCode` method retrieves the code for a particular contract with the given address hash and code hash. The `ContractCodeSize` method retrieves the size of the code for a particular contract with the given address hash and code hash.

The `DiskDB` method returns the underlying key-value disk database. The `TrieDB` method retrieves the low-level trie database used for data storage.

The `Trie` interface provides methods to get and update the state trie. The `GetKey` method returns the sha3 preimage of a hashed key that was previously used to store a value. The `GetStorage` method returns the value for a key stored in the trie. The `GetAccount` method retrieves an account blob from the trie with the provided account address and decodes it. The `UpdateStorage` method associates a key with a value in the trie. The `UpdateAccount` method encodes the provided account object and updates it in the trie with the provided address. The `DeleteStorage` method deletes a key from the trie.

The `codeSizeCacheSize` constant defines the number of codehash->size associations to keep. The `codeCacheSize` constant defines the cache size granted for caching clean code. The source code provided is for a state database that uses a trie data structure to store and manage state information. The trie data structure is a tree-like data structure that is used to store key-value pairs. The state database is used to store the state of the Ethereum blockchain, including account balances, contract code, and contract storage.

The `DeleteStorage` function removes any existing value for a given key from the trie. If a node was not found in the database, a `trie.MissingNodeError` is returned.

The `DeleteAccount` function abstracts an account deletion from the trie.

The `Hash` function returns the root hash of the trie. It does not write to the database and can be used even if the trie doesn't have one.

The `Commit` function collects all dirty nodes in the trie and replaces them with the corresponding node hash. All collected nodes (including dirty leaves if `collectLeaf` is true) will be encapsulated into a nodeset for return. The returned nodeset can be nil if the trie is clean (nothing to commit). Once the trie is committed, it's not usable anymore. A new trie must be created with a new root and updated trie database for following usage.

The `NodeIterator` function returns an iterator that returns nodes of the trie. Iteration starts at the key after the given start key.

The `Prove` function constructs a Merkle proof for a given key. The result contains all encoded nodes on the path to the value at the key. The value itself is also included in the last node and can be retrieved by verifying the proof. If the trie does not contain a value for the key, the returned proof contains all nodes of the longest existing prefix of the key (at least the root), ending with the node that proves the absence of the key.

The `NewDatabase` function creates a backing store for state. The returned database is safe for concurrent use but does not retain any recent trie nodes in memory. To keep some historical state in memory, use the `NewDatabaseWithConfig` constructor.

The `NewDatabaseWithConfig` function creates a backing store for state. The returned database is safe for concurrent use and retains a lot of collapsed RLP trie nodes in a large memory cache.

The `NewDatabaseWithNodeDB` function creates a state database with an already initialized node database.

The `cachingDB` struct is a caching database that implements the `Database` interface. It contains a disk database, a code size cache, a code cache, and a trie database.

The `OpenTrie` function opens the main account trie at a specific root hash.

The `OpenStorageTrie` function opens the storage trie of an account.

The `CopyTrie` function returns an independent copy of the given trie. ## cachingDB

The `cachingDB` struct is a caching layer on top of a disk-based key-value store. It provides methods for retrieving contract code and contract code size, as well as accessing the underlying disk database and trie-node caching layer.

### CopyTrie

```go
func (db *cachingDB) CopyTrie(t Trie) Trie {
	switch t := t.(type) {
	case *trie.StateTrie:
		return t.Copy()
	default:
		panic(fmt.Errorf("unknown trie type %T", t))
	}
}
```

The `CopyTrie` method copies a trie. It takes a `Trie` as an argument and returns a new `Trie`. If the `Trie` is a `StateTrie`, it calls the `Copy` method on the `StateTrie` and returns the result. Otherwise, it panics with an error message.

### ContractCode

```go
func (db *cachingDB) ContractCode(addrHash, codeHash common.Hash) ([]byte, error) {
	code, _ := db.codeCache.Get(codeHash)
	if len(code) > 0 {
		return code, nil
	}
	code = rawdb.ReadCode(db.disk, codeHash)
	if len(code) > 0 {
		db.codeCache.Add(codeHash, code)
		db.codeSizeCache.Add(codeHash, len(code))
		return code, nil
	}
	return nil, errors.New("not found")
}
```

The `ContractCode` method retrieves the code for a particular contract. It takes two `common.Hash` arguments: `addrHash` and `codeHash`. It first checks the code cache for the `codeHash`. If the code is found in the cache, it returns the code. Otherwise, it reads the code from the disk database using the `rawdb.ReadCode` method. If the code is found on disk, it adds the code to the cache and returns it. If the code is not found on disk, it returns an error.

### ContractCodeWithPrefix

```go
func (db *cachingDB) ContractCodeWithPrefix(addrHash, codeHash common.Hash) ([]byte, error) {
	code, _ := db.codeCache.Get(codeHash)
	if len(code) > 0 {
		return code, nil
	}
	code = rawdb.ReadCodeWithPrefix(db.disk, codeHash)
	if len(code) > 0 {
		db.codeCache.Add(codeHash, code)
		db.codeSizeCache.Add(codeHash, len(code))
		return code, nil
	}
	return nil, errors.New("not found")
}
```

The `ContractCodeWithPrefix` method retrieves the code for a particular contract. It takes two `common.Hash` arguments: `addrHash` and `codeHash`. It first checks the code cache for the `codeHash`. If the code is found in the cache, it returns the code. Otherwise, it reads the code from the disk database using the `rawdb.ReadCodeWithPrefix` method. If the code is found on disk, it adds the code to the cache and returns it. If the code is not found on disk, it returns an error.

### ContractCodeSize

```go
func (db *cachingDB) ContractCodeSize(addrHash, codeHash common.Hash) (int, error) {
	if cached, ok := db.codeSizeCache.Get(codeHash); ok {
		return cached, nil
	}
	code, err := db.ContractCode(addrHash, codeHash)
	return len(code), err
}
```

The `ContractCodeSize` method retrieves the size of the code for a particular contract. It takes two `common.Hash` arguments: `addrHash` and `codeHash`. It first checks the code size cache for the `codeHash`. If the size is found in the cache, it returns the size. Otherwise, it calls the `ContractCode` method to retrieve the code and returns the length of the code. If the code is not found, it returns an error.

### DiskDB

```go
func (db *cachingDB) DiskDB() ethdb.KeyValueStore {
	return db.disk
}
```

The `DiskDB` method returns the underlying disk-based key-value store.

### TrieDB

```go
func (db *cachingDB) TrieDB() *trie.Database {
	return db.triedb
}
```

The `TrieDB` method returns the intermediate trie-node caching layer.
