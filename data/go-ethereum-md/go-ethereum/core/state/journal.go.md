The `state` package provides an implementation of the Ethereum state transition system. The state transition system is responsible for managing the state of the Ethereum blockchain, including account balances, contract code, and storage.

The `journalEntry` interface defines a modification entry in the state change journal that can be reverted on demand. The `revert` method undoes the changes introduced by this journal entry, and the `dirtied` method returns the Ethereum address modified by this journal entry.

The `journal` struct contains the list of state modifications applied since the last state commit. These are tracked to be able to be reverted in the case of an execution exception or request for reversal. The `entries` field is a slice of `journalEntry` objects, and the `dirties` field is a map of Ethereum addresses modified by the journal entries and the number of changes.

The `newJournal` function creates a new initialized journal. The `append` method inserts a new modification entry to the end of the change journal. The `revert` method undoes a batch of journalled modifications along with any reverted dirty handling too. The `dirty` method explicitly sets an address to dirty, even if the change entries would otherwise suggest it as clean. The `length` method returns the current number of entries in the journal.

The `createObjectChange`, `resetObjectChange`, `suicideChange`, `balanceChange`, `nonceChange`, `storageChange`, `codeChange`, `refundChange`, `addLogChange`, `addPreimageChange`, and `touchChange` types are all different types of journal entries that implement the `journalEntry` interface. These types represent different types of changes to the Ethereum state, including changes to account balances, contract code, and storage.

Overall, the `state` package provides a comprehensive implementation of the Ethereum state transition system, including the ability to track and revert state modifications using the state change journal. This is a set of functions that are used to revert changes made to the Ethereum state database. These functions are part of the `StateDB` package, which is used to manage the state of the Ethereum blockchain.

Each function is associated with a specific type of change that can be made to the state database. For example, the `createObjectChange` function is used to revert changes made when a new account is created, while the `balanceChange` function is used to revert changes made to an account's balance.

Each function takes a `StateDB` object as a parameter, which represents the current state of the Ethereum blockchain. The function then reverts the change made to the state database by modifying the `StateDB` object.

The `dirtied` function is used to determine which accounts have been modified by the change. It returns a pointer to the account that has been modified, or `nil` if no account has been modified.

Here is an example of how you can document the `createObjectChange` function in Markdown format:

## createObjectChange

This function is used to revert changes made when a new account is created.

### Parameters

- `s`: A `StateDB` object representing the current state of the Ethereum blockchain.

### Behavior

1. Deletes the state object associated with the account that was created.
2. Removes the account from the list of dirty accounts.

### Example

```go
func (ch createObjectChange) revert(s *StateDB) {
	delete(s.stateObjects, *ch.account)
	delete(s.stateObjectsDirty, *ch.account)
}
```
