# Log Type

The `Log` type represents a contract log event. These events are generated by the `LOG` opcode and stored/indexed by the node. The `Log` type contains both consensus fields and derived fields. The consensus fields are the address of the contract that generated the event, the list of topics provided by the contract, and the data supplied by the contract. The derived fields are the block in which the transaction was included, the hash of the transaction, the index of the transaction in the block, the hash of the block in which the transaction was included, the index of the log in the block, and the `Removed` field.

## Methods

### `EncodeRLP`

`EncodeRLP` encodes the `Log` type using RLP.

```go
func (l *Log) EncodeRLP(w io.Writer) error
```

#### Parameters

- `w` - the writer to write the encoded `Log` type to.

#### Return Values

- `error` - an error, if any.

### `DecodeRLP`

`DecodeRLP` decodes the `Log` type using RLP.

```go
func (l *Log) DecodeRLP(s *rlp.Stream) error
```

#### Parameters

- `s` - the RLP stream to decode the `Log` type from.

#### Return Values

- `error` - an error, if any.
