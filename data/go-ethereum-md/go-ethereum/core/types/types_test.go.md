# Types Package

The `types` package is a part of the `go-ethereum` library, which is a free software that can be redistributed and/or modified under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. This package contains the data types used in the Ethereum blockchain, including headers, transactions, receipts, and logs.

## Variables

### `ReceiptStatusSuccessful`

`ReceiptStatusSuccessful` is a constant that represents a successful receipt status.

## Functions

### `BenchmarkEncodeRLP`

`BenchmarkEncodeRLP` is a benchmark function that encodes RLP data.

```go
func BenchmarkEncodeRLP(b *testing.B)
```

#### Parameters

- `b` - the benchmark object.

### `BenchmarkDecodeRLP`

`BenchmarkDecodeRLP` is a benchmark function that decodes RLP data.

```go
func BenchmarkDecodeRLP(b *testing.B)
```

#### Parameters

- `b` - the benchmark object.

### `benchRLP`

`benchRLP` is a helper function that benchmarks RLP encoding and decoding.

```go
func benchRLP(b *testing.B, encode bool)
```

#### Parameters

- `b` - the benchmark object.
- `encode` - a boolean value indicating whether to encode or decode RLP data.

## Types

### `devnull`

`devnull` is a struct that implements the `io.Writer` interface and discards all data written to it.

```go
type devnull struct{ len int }
```

#### Methods

##### `Write`

`Write` is a method that implements the `io.Writer` interface and discards all data written to it.

```go
func (d *devnull) Write(p []byte) (int, error)
```

#### Parameters

- `p` - the data to write.

#### Return Values

- `int` - the number of bytes written.
- `error` - an error, if any.

### `benchRLP` Test Cases

The `benchRLP` function benchmarks the encoding and decoding of various RLP data types. The test cases are as follows:

#### `legacy-header`

A legacy header with a difficulty of 10,000,000,000, a block number of 1,000, a gas limit of 8,000,000, a gas used of 8,000,000, a timestamp of 555, and an extra field of 32 bytes.

#### `london-header`

A London header with the same values as the legacy header, as well as a base fee of 10,000,000,000.

#### `receipt-for-storage`

A receipt for storage with a successful status, a cumulative gas used of 0x888888888, and an empty log array.

#### `receipt-full`

A full receipt with the same values as the receipt for storage.

#### `legacy-transaction`

A legacy transaction with a nonce of 1, a gas price of 500, a gas limit of 1,000,000, a recipient address of 0x00000000000000000000000000000000deadbeef, and a value of 1.

#### `access-transaction`

An access list transaction with the same values as the legacy transaction.

#### `1559-transaction`

A 1559 transaction with the same values as the legacy transaction, as well as a gas tip cap and gas fee cap of 500.
