## Types Package

The `types` package is a part of the `go-ethereum` library, which is a free software that can be redistributed and/or modified under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. This package contains the data types used in the Ethereum blockchain, including transactions, blocks, and accounts.

### TestEIP155Signing

`TestEIP155Signing` is a test function that tests the EIP-155 signing functionality. It generates a new key, creates a new signer with a chain ID of 18, creates a new transaction, signs the transaction with the signer and the key, and verifies that the sender of the transaction is the same as the address associated with the key.

### TestEIP155ChainId

`TestEIP155ChainId` is a test function that tests the EIP-155 chain ID functionality. It generates a new key, creates a new signer with a chain ID of 18, creates a new transaction, signs the transaction with the signer and the key, and verifies that the transaction is protected and that the chain ID of the transaction is the same as the chain ID of the signer. It then creates a new transaction, signs the transaction with the Homestead signer and the key, and verifies that the transaction is not protected and that the chain ID of the transaction is 0.

### TestEIP155SigningVitalik

`TestEIP155SigningVitalik` is a test function that tests the EIP-155 signing functionality using test vectors from Vitalik Buterin. It creates a new transaction from the RLP-encoded transaction and address strings in the test vector, and verifies that the sender of the transaction is the same as the address in the test vector.

### NewTransaction

`NewTransaction` creates a new transaction with the given nonce, recipient, value, gas limit, gas price, and data.

```go
func NewTransaction(nonce uint64, to common.Address, amount *big.Int, gasLimit uint64, gasPrice *big.Int, data []byte) *Transaction
```

#### Parameters

- `nonce` - the nonce of the transaction.
- `to` - the recipient of the transaction.
- `amount` - the amount of ether to send in the transaction.
- `gasLimit` - the gas limit of the transaction.
- `gasPrice` - the gas price of the transaction.
- `data` - the data payload of the transaction.

#### Return Values

- `*Transaction` - the new transaction.

### SignTx

`SignTx` signs the given transaction with the given signer and key.

```go
func SignTx(tx *Transaction, s Signer, prv *ecdsa.PrivateKey) (*Transaction, error)
```

#### Parameters

- `tx` - the transaction to sign.
- `s` - the signer to use.
- `prv` - the private key to use for signing.

#### Return Values

- `*Transaction` - the signed transaction.
- `error` - an error, if any.

### Sender

`Sender` returns the address of the sender of the given transaction.

```go
func Sender(s Signer, tx *Transaction) (common.Address, error)
```

#### Parameters

- `s` - the signer used to sign the transaction.
- `tx` - the transaction to get the sender address from.

#### Return Values

- `common.Address` - the address of the sender.
- `error` - an error, if any.

### NewEIP155Signer

`NewEIP155Signer` creates a new EIP-155 signer with the given chain ID.

```go
func NewEIP155Signer(chainID *big.Int) *EIP155Signer
```

#### Parameters

- `chainID` - the chain ID to use.

#### Return Values

- `*EIP ## Function Documentation

### `TestSender`

The `TestSender` function tests the `Sender` function by decoding a transaction from RLP and checking if the sender address matches the expected address.

#### Parameters

- `t` - a testing object.

#### Return Values

This function does not return any values.

### `TestChainId`

The `TestChainId` function tests the `Sender` function with different chain IDs to ensure that the correct error is returned when the chain ID is invalid.

#### Parameters

- `t` - a testing object.

#### Return Values

This function does not return any values.
