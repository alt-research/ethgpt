# Documentation for `types` package

## Introduction

The `types` package is a part of the `go-ethereum` library, which is a free software that can be redistributed and/or modified under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. This package contains the data types used in the Ethereum blockchain, including the `Withdrawal` struct.

## `Withdrawal` struct

The `Withdrawal` struct represents a withdrawal from the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract. It contains the following fields:

- `Index` - the index of the withdrawal.
- `Validator` - the index of the validator that initiated the withdrawal.
- `Address` - the address to which the withdrawal was made.
- `Amount` - the amount of Ether withdrawn.

## `EncodeRLP` function

The `EncodeRLP` function is a method of the `Withdrawal` struct that encodes the struct into RLP format. RLP (Recursive Length Prefix) is a serialization format used in Ethereum to encode data structures.

### Parameters

- `_w` - an `io.Writer` interface that the encoded RLP data will be written to.

### Return Value

- `error` - an error, if any.

### Example

```go
import (
    "bytes"
    "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/rlp"
    "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/core/types"
)

func main() {
    withdrawal := types.Withdrawal{
        Index:     1,
        Validator: 2,
        Address:   [20]byte{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20},
        Amount:    1000000000000000000,
    }

    var buf bytes.Buffer
    err := withdrawal.EncodeRLP(&buf)
    if err != nil {
        // handle error
    }

    encoded := buf.Bytes()
    // use encoded data
}
```
