Package `rawdb` provides a memory-mapped append-only database to store immutable ordered data into flat files. The `Freezer` struct is the main type in this package, which is a memory-mapped append-only database to store immutable ordered data into flat files. The `Freezer` struct has the following fields:

- `frozen` - an atomic uint64 that represents the number of blocks already frozen.
- `tail` - an atomic uint64 that represents the number of the first stored item in the freezer.
- `writeLock` - a RWMutex that synchronizes writers and the truncate operation, as well as the "atomic" (batched) read operations.
- `writeBatch` - a pointer to a `freezerBatch` struct that represents a batch of writes to the freezer.
- `readonly` - a boolean that indicates whether the freezer is opened in read-only mode.
- `tables` - a map of string keys to `freezerTable` values that represent the data tables for storing everything.
- `instanceLock` - a `flock.Flock` that is a file-system lock to prevent double opens.
- `closeOnce` - a `sync.Once` that ensures the `Close` method is only called once.

The `NewChainFreezer` function is a utility method around `NewFreezer` that sets the default parameters for the chain storage. The `NewFreezer` function creates a `Freezer` instance for maintaining immutable ordered data according to the given parameters. The `tables` argument defines the data tables. If the value of a map entry is true, snappy compression is disabled for the table.

The package also defines several errors that can be returned by the `Freezer` methods:

- `errReadOnly` is The `Freezer` package is a part of the `go-ethereum` library, which is a free software that can be redistributed and/or modified under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. This package contains the implementation of the chain freezer, which is responsible for storing and retrieving ancient data from the Ethereum blockchain.

## Variables

### `namespace`

`namespace` is a constant that represents the namespace of the freezer.

### `infoGauge`

`infoGauge` is a gauge that represents the information about the freezer.

## Types

### `Freezer`

`Freezer` is a struct that represents the chain freezer.

#### Fields

- `readonly` - a boolean that indicates whether the freezer is read-only.
- `tables` - a map that contains the supported data tables.
- `instanceLock` - a file lock that prevents multiple instances of the freezer from accessing the same data directory.
- `writeBatch` - a write batch that is used to write data to the freezer.
- `frozen` - an atomic counter that represents the length of the frozen items.
- `tail` Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a professional documentation and explanation for the source code in Markdown format:

### Variables

#### `errUnknownTable`

`errUnknownTable` is an error that is returned when an unknown table is accessed.

#### `errReadOnly`

`errReadOnly` is an error that is returned when a write operation is attempted on a read-only freezer.

### Types

#### `Freezer`

`Freezer` is a struct that represents a freezer database.

##### Fields

- `tables` - a map of table names to table instances.
- `frozen` - the index of the last frozen item.
- `tail` ## Freezer Package

### Variables

#### `errReadOnly`

`errReadOnly` is an error that is returned when attempting to write to a read-only freezer.

#### `errUnknownTable`

`errUnknownTable` is an error that is returned when attempting to access an unknown table.
