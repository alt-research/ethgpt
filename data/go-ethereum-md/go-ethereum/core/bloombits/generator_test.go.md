# Bloombits Package

The `bloombits` package is a Go implementation of a bloom filter. It provides a generator that can be used to create a bloom filter from a set of input bloom filters.

## TestGenerator Function

The `TestGenerator` function is a test function that verifies that batched bloom bits are correctly rotated from the input bloom filters. It generates the input and the rotated output, then crunches the input through the generator and verifies the result.

### Parameters

This function does not take any parameters.

### Return Value

This function does not return any values.

## BenchmarkGenerator Function

The `BenchmarkGenerator` function is a benchmark function that measures the performance of the generator. It generates a set of random input bloom filters and crunches them through the generator.

### Parameters

This function does not take any parameters.

### Return Value

This function does not return any values.
