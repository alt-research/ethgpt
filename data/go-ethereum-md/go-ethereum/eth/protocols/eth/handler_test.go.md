## Introduction

This document provides documentation for the source code of a testBackend struct in a Go codebase. The testBackend struct is a mock implementation of the live Ethereum message handler. Its purpose is to allow testing the request/reply workflows and wire serialization in the `eth` protocol without actually doing any data processing. The codebase is written in Go programming language.

## testBackend Struct

The testBackend struct is defined as follows:

```go
type testBackend struct {
    db     ethdb.Database
    chain  *core.BlockChain
    txpool *txpool.TxPool
}
```

### newTestBackend Function

The `newTestBackend` function creates an empty chain and wraps it into a mock backend. The function takes an integer parameter `blocks` which represents the number of blocks to create.

```go
func newTestBackend(blocks int) *testBackend {
    return newTestBackendWithGenerator(blocks, false, nil) ## Introduction

This document provides documentation for the source code of a testBackend struct in a Go codebase. The testBackend struct is used for testing purposes and is responsible for setting up a mock blockchain backend. The codebase is written in Go programming language.

## testBackend Struct

The testBackend struct is defined as follows:

```go
type testBackend struct {
	db     ethdb.Database
	chain  *core.BlockChain
	txpool TxPool
}
```

### newTestBackend Function

The `newTestBackend` function is responsible This code snippet is a part of the Ethereum protocol implementation and is responsible for handling the retrieval of block headers from the blockchain. The function is called `TestGetBlockHeaders` and is used for testing purposes.

The function takes in a `backend` object, which represents the blockchain, and a `limit` parameter, which is the maximum number of block headers that can be retrieved. The function then proceeds to test various scenarios for retrieving block headers using the `GetBlockHeadersPacket` object.

The `GetBlockHeadersPacket` object contains information about the origin block header, the number of block headers to retrieve, and the number of block headers to skip. The `Reverse` parameter is used to indicate whether the block headers should be retrieved in reverse order.

The function tests various scenarios, such as retrieving block headers from the middle of the blockchain, retrieving block headers from the start and end of the blockchain, and testing the protocol limits for retrieving block headers.

Each scenario is tested by passing a `GetBlockHeadersPacket` object to the function and comparing the retrieved block headers with the expected block headers. The expected block headers are stored in an array of `common.Hash` objects.

For example, in the first scenario, the function retrieves three block headers from the middle of the blockchain, starting from the block header at `limit/2`. The expected block headers are the block header at `limit/2`, the block header at `limit/2-1`, and the block header at `limit/2-2`. These block headers are stored in an array of `common.Hash` objects.

The function then compares the retrieved block headers with the expected block headers and returns an error if they do not match.

Overall, this function is used to test the functionality of the block header retrieval mechanism in the Ethereum protocol implementation. It tests various scenarios to ensure that the mechanism works correctly and that the protocol limits are honored. ## Introduction

This document provides documentation for the source code of a Go codebase. The codebase contains test functions for retrieving block headers and block contents from a remote chain based on their hashes. The codebase is written in Go programming language.

## TestGetBlockHeaders Function

The `TestGetBlockHeaders` function tests the retrieval of block headers from a remote chain based on their hashes. The function creates a batch of tests for various scenarios and runs each of the tests, verifying the results against the chain The code you provided is a part of the Ethereum protocol implementation in Go language. It includes tests for the `GetBlockBodies` and `GetNodeData` functions, which are used to retrieve block bodies and state trie nodes, respectively, from other nodes in the Ethereum network.

Let's go through the code and explain each function and test case in detail:

### GetBlockBodies

This function is used to retrieve block bodies from other nodes in the Ethereum network. It takes a list of block hashes and returns a list of block bodies. The function first generates a list of block hashes to request, including both existing and non-existing blocks. It then sends a `GetBlockBodies` message to the peer node and waits for a response containing the requested block bodies. Finally, it verifies that the received block bodies match the expected ones.

### TestGetBlockBodies

This test case tests the `GetBlockBodies` function by creating a mock Ethereum network and sending various requests for block bodies to it. The test case includes several test scenarios, each with a different set of block hashes to request. The test case verifies that the received block bodies match the expected ones for each scenario.

### GetNodeData

This function is used to retrieve state trie nodes from other nodes in the Ethereum network. It takes a list of node hashes and returns a list of node data. The function first generates a list of node hashes to request, including both existing and non-existing nodes. It then sends a `GetNodeData` message to the peer node and waits for a response containing the requested node data. Finally, it verifies that the received node data match the expected ones.

### TestGetNodeData

This test case tests the `GetNodeData` function by creating a mock Ethereum network and sending various requests for state trie nodes to it. The test case includes several test scenarios, each with a different set of node hashes to request. The test case verifies that the received node data match the expected ones for each scenario.

Overall, these functions and test cases are essential for the proper functioning of the Ethereum protocol. They allow nodes to retrieve block bodies and state trie nodes from other nodes in the network, which is necessary for verifying transactions and maintaining consensus. This code is testing the ability to retrieve transaction receipts and state data from a node on the Ethereum network. The code is written in Go and uses the Ethereum protocol version 66, 67, or 68 depending on the test being run.

The `TestGetBlockReceipts` function is the main test function that is called by the three other test functions (`TestGetBlockReceipts66`, `TestGetBlockReceipts67`, and `TestGetBlockReceipts68`). The `TestGetBlockReceipts` function takes in a testing object and a protocol version as input parameters. The function is parallelized using the `t.Parallel()` statement.

The test creates two Ethereum accounts (`acc1Addr` and `acc2Addr`) and defines a signer object using the Homestead signing algorithm. The `generator` function is defined to create a chain of blocks with some simple transactions. The transactions include sending some ether from the test bank to `acc1Addr` and `acc2Addr`.

The `newTestBackendWithGenerator` function is called to create a new test backend with the specified number of blocks and the `generator` function. The `defer` statement is used to ensure that the `backend` object is closed after the test is completed.

The `newTestPeer` function is called to create a new test peer with the specified name, protocol, and backend. The `defer` statement is used to ensure that the `peer` object is closed after the test is completed.

The code then collects all state tree hashes using an iterator and requests all hashes using the `GetNodeDataMsg` message. The response is then decoded and verified to ensure that all hashes correspond to the requested data. The state tree is then reconstructed from the received data and a sanity check is performed to ensure that all state matches.

The `testGetBlockReceipts` function is called by the `TestGetBlockReceipts` function to perform the actual test. The function takes in a testing object and a protocol version as input parameters. The function is parallelized using the `t.Parallel()` statement.

The function creates a chain generator with some simple transactions and adds them to the block. The function then retrieves the transaction receipts and verifies that they can be retrieved based on hashes.

Overall, this code tests the ability to retrieve transaction receipts and state data from a node on the Ethereum network using the specified protocol version. The code is well-documented and uses clear and concise descriptions of each function. ## Introduction

This document provides documentation for the source code of a test function in a Go codebase. The test function is responsible for testing the receipt retrieval functionality of a blockchain node. The codebase is written in Go programming language.

## Test Function

The test function is defined as follows:

```go
func TestReceiptRetrieval(t *testing.T) {
    // test code
}
```

### Test Environment

The test environment is assembled using a `newTestBackendWithGenerator` function which creates a new backend with a given block generator. The `backend` is used to create a new `peer` which is used to send a hash request and verify the response.

```go
backend := newTestBackendWithGenerator(4, false, generator)
defer backend.close()

peer, _ := newTestPeer("peer", protocol, backend)
defer peer.close()
```

### Test Blocks

The test blocks are created using a `BlockGenerator` struct which generates a sequence of blocks with different properties. The `BlockGenerator` struct is defined as follows:

```go
type BlockGenerator struct {
    // fields
}
```

The `BlockGenerator` struct has a `Generate` method which generates a new block with a given index. The `Generate` method is defined as follows:

```go
func (g *BlockGenerator) Generate(index uint64) *types.Block {
    // code
}
```

The `Generate` method generates a new block with a given index. The block is created with different properties depending on the index. The properties include the coinbase address, extra data, and transactions.

### Test Hashes and Receipts

The test hashes and receipts are collected using a loop that iterates over all the blocks in the blockchain. The `hashes` slice contains the hashes of all the blocks in the blockchain, and the `receipts` slice contains the receipts of all the blocks in the blockchain.

```go
var (
    hashes   []common.Hash
    receipts [][]*types.Receipt
)
for i := uint64(0); i <= backend.chain.CurrentBlock().Number.Uint64(); i++ {
    block := backend.chain.GetBlockByNumber(i)

    hashes = append(hashes, block.Hash())
    receipts = append(receipts, backend.chain.GetReceiptsByHash(block.Hash()))
}
```

### Test Request and Response

The test request and response are sent and verified using the `p2p.Send` and `p2p.ExpectMsg` functions. The `p2p.Send` function sends a hash request to the peer, and the `p2p.ExpectMsg` function verifies the response from the peer.

```go
p2p.Send(peer.app, GetReceiptsMsg, &GetReceiptsPacket66{
    RequestId:         123,
    GetReceiptsPacket: hashes,
})
if err := p2p.ExpectMsg
