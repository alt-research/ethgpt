## Introduction

This document provides documentation for the source code of an Ethereum protocol implementation in a Go codebase. The codebase is written in Go programming language.

## Constants

The code defines several constants to match up protocol versions and messages. The constants are as follows:

- `ETH66`, `ETH67`, and `ETH68` are the supported versions of the `eth` protocol.
- `ProtocolName` is the official short name of the `eth` protocol used during devp2p capability negotiation.
- `ProtocolVersions` is a slice of uint values representing the supported versions of the `eth` protocol.
- `protocolLengths` is a map of uint to uint64 values representing the number of implemented messages corresponding to different protocol versions.
- `maxMessageSize` is the maximum cap on the size of a protocol message.

The code also defines several constants representing the message types.

## Packet Interface

The `Packet` interface represents a p2p message in the `eth` protocol. The interface has two methods:

- `Name()` returns a string corresponding to the message type.
- `Kind()` returns the message type. ## Introduction

This document provides documentation for the source code of a Go codebase. The codebase contains several structs and functions that are used for network communication in a blockchain node. The codebase is written in Go programming language.

## NewBlockHashesPacket Struct

The `NewBlockHashesPacket` struct is a network packet for broadcasting new block hashes. The struct has a `Unpack` function that unpacks the packet and returns two slices: one containing the block hashes and the other containing the block numbers.

```go
type NewBlockHashesPacket []*BlockHash

func (p *NewBlockHashesPacket) Unpack() ([]common.Hash, []uint64) {
    var (
        hashes  = make([]common.Hash, len(*p))
        numbers = make([]uint64, len(*p))
    )
    for i, body := range *p {
        hashes[i], numbers[i] = body.Hash, body.Number
    }
    return hashes, numbers
}
```

## TransactionsPacket ## Introduction

This document provides documentation for the source code of a Go codebase. The codebase contains various structs and types used for network communication in a blockchain node. The structs and types are written in Go programming language.

## Structs and Types

### BlockBodiesPacket

The `BlockBodiesPacket` type is used for replying to block body requests. It contains a slice of `BlockBody` types, which represent the data content of a single block.

```go
type BlockBodiesPacket []BlockBody
```

### BlockBodiesRLPPacket

The `BlockBodiesRLPPacket` type is used for replying to block body requests, in cases where we already have them RLP-encoded, and thus can avoid the decode-encode roundtrip. It contains a slice of `rlp.RawValue` types.

```go
type BlockBodiesRLPPacket []rlp.RawValue
```

### BlockBodiesRLPPacket66

The `BlockBodiesRLPPacket66` type is the `BlockBodiesRLPPacket` over eth/66. It contains a ` ## Introduction

This document provides documentation for the source code of a Go codebase. The codebase contains several functions and a struct related to Ethereum network communication. The functions are used to define the name and kind of various packets used in the Ethereum network.

## PooledTransactionsRLPPacket66 Struct

The `PooledTransactionsRLPPacket66` struct is the eth/66 form of `PooledTransactionsRLPPacket`. It has two fields: `RequestId` which is a uint64 type representing the request ID, and `PooledTransactionsRLPPacket` which is a struct representing the pooled transactions RLP packet.

```go
type PooledTransactionsRLPPacket66 struct {
    RequestId uint64
    PooledTransactionsRLPPacket
}
```

## Functions

### Name Function

The `Name` function returns the name of a packet. It is implemented by several packet types including `StatusPacket`, `NewBlockHashesPacket`, `TransactionsPacket`, `GetBlockHeadersPacket`, `BlockHeadersPacket`, `GetBlockBodiesPacket`, `BlockBodiesPacket`, `NewBlockPacket`, `GetNodeDataPacket`, `NodeDataPacket`, `GetReceiptsPacket`, `ReceiptsPacket`, `NewPooledTransactionHashesPacket66`, `NewPooledTransactionHashesPacket68`, `GetPooledTransactionsPacket`, and `PooledTransactionsPacket`.

```go
func (*StatusPacket) Name() string { return "Status" }
func (*NewBlockHashesPacket) Name() string { return "NewBlockHashes" }
func (*TransactionsPacket) Name() string { return "Transactions" }
func (*GetBlockHeadersPacket) Name() string { return "GetBlockHeaders" }
func (*BlockHeadersPacket) Name() string { return "BlockHeaders" }
func (*GetBlockBodiesPacket) Name() string { return "GetBlockBodies" }
func (*BlockBodiesPacket) Name() string { return "BlockBodies" }
func (*NewBlockPacket) Name() string { return "NewBlock" }
func (*GetNodeDataPacket) Name() string { return "GetNodeData" }
func (*NodeDataPacket) Name() string { return "NodeData" }
func (*GetReceiptsPacket) Name() string { return "GetReceipts" }
func (*ReceiptsPacket) Name() string { return "Receipts" }
func (*NewPooledTransactionHash
