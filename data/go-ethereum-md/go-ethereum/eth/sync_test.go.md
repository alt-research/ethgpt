### Function: TestSnapSyncDisabling66

```go
func TestSnapSyncDisabling66(t *testing.T) { testSnapSyncDisabling(t, eth.ETH66, snap.SNAP1) }
```

This function is a test function that tests whether snap sync is disabled after a successful sync cycle. It takes a testing object as an argument and calls the `testSnapSyncDisabling` function with the `eth.ETH66` and `snap.SNAP1` arguments.

### Function: TestSnapSyncDisabling67

```go
func TestSnapSyncDisabling67(t *testing.T) { testSnapSyncDisabling(t, eth.ETH67, snap.SNAP1) }
```

This function is a test function that tests whether snap sync is disabled after a successful sync cycle. It takes a testing object as an argument and calls the `testSnapSyncDisabling` function with the `eth.ETH67` and `snap.SNAP1` arguments.

### Function: testSnapSyncDisabling

```go
func testSnapSyncDisabling(t *testing.T, ethVer uint, snapVer uint) {
	// ...
}
```

This function is a helper function that tests whether snap sync is disabled after a successful sync cycle. It takes a testing object, an Ethereum version, and a snap version as arguments. It creates an empty handler and ensures that it is in snap sync mode. It then creates a full handler and ensures that snap sync is disabled. It syncs up the two handlers via both `eth` and `snap`. Finally, it checks that snap sync was disabled. # Documentation for Ethereum Codebase

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Ethereum codebase. The Ethereum codebase is a collection of software programs that enable the creation and execution of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The codebase is written in the Go programming language and is open-source, meaning that anyone can contribute to its development.

## Functions

### GenerateChain

```go
func GenerateChain(n int) ([]*types.Block, error)
```

The `GenerateChain` function is used to generate a new blockchain with `n` blocks. It returns a slice of `*types.Block` pointers and an error if one occurs. The function uses the `NewBlock` function to create each block and sets the appropriate fields such as the block number, timestamp, and difficulty.

### NewBlock

```go
func NewBlock(parent *types.Block, coinbase common.Address, txs []*types.Transaction, uncles []*types.Header, time uint64, extra []byte) *types.Block
```

The `NewBlock` function is used to create a new block. It takes in the parent block, the coinbase address, a slice of transactions, a slice of uncle headers, the timestamp, and any extra data. It returns a new `*types.Block` pointer with the appropriate fields set.

### NewFullNode

```go
func NewFullNode(chain []*types.Block) *FullNode
```

The `NewFullNode` function is used to create a new full node. It takes in a slice of `*types.Block` pointers and returns a new `*FullNode` pointer. The `FullNode` struct is used to represent a full node on the Ethereum network.

### NewODR

```go
func NewODR() *ODR
```

The `NewODR` function is used to create a new ODR (Optimistic Data Retrieval) instance. It returns a new `*ODR` pointer. The `ODR` struct is used to represent an ODR node on the Ethereum network.

### RetrieveBlock

```go
func (odr *ODR) RetrieveBlock(hash common.Hash) (*types.Block, error)
```

The `RetrieveBlock` function is used to retrieve a block from the ODR node. It takes in the block hash and returns a `*types.Block` pointer and an error if one occurs. The function first checks if the block is in the ODR cache and returns it if it is. If the block is not in the cache, it sends a request to the full node to retrieve the block.

### TestODR

```go
func (odr *ODR) TestODR(b *types.Block, parentHash, prevHash, uncleHash common.Hash, coinbase common.Address, difficulty *big.Int, number uint64, gasLimit uint64, gasUsed uint64, timestamp uint64, extra []byte, mixDigest, nonce common.Hash, txHash, receiptHash common.Hash, bloom types.Bloom, txs []*types.Transaction, receipts []*types.Receipt, state *state.StateDB, logsBloom types.Bloom, gasRefund, gasReward *big.Int, gasRefundReceipts, gasRewardReceipts []*types.Receipt, gasUsedByTx, gasUsedByBlock, gasUsedByUncles, gasUsedByUncle *big.Int, gasUsedByUncleBlock, gasUsedByUncleBlockReceipts, gasUsedByUncleBlockReward, gasUsedByUncleBlockRefund *big.Int, gasUsedByUncleBlockRefundReceipts, gasUsedByUncleBlockRewardReceipts, gasUsedByUncleBlockRefundReceiptsReceipts, gasUsedByUncleBlockRewardReceiptsReceipts *big.Int, gasUsedByUncleBlockRefundReceiptsReceiptsReceipts, gasUsedByUncleBlockRewardReceiptsReceiptsReceipts *big.Int, gasUsedByUncleBlockRefundReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceipts, gasUsedByUncleBlockRewardReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceipts *big.Int, gasUsedByUncleBlockRefundReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceipts, gasUsedByUncleBlockRewardReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceipts *big.Int, gasUsedByUncleBlockRefundReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceipts, gasUsedByUncleBlockRewardReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceipts *big.Int, gasUsedByUncleBlockRefundReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceipts, gasUsedByUncleBlockRewardReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceipts *big.Int, gasUsedByUncleBlockRefundReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceipts, gasUsedByUncleBlockRewardReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceipts *big.Int, gasUsedByUncleBlockRefundReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceipts, gasUsedByUncleBlockRewardReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceiptsReceipts *big.Int)
```

The `TestODR` function is used to test the ODR node. It takes in a `*types.Block` pointer and various block fields such as the parent hash, coinbase address, and difficulty. It also takes in a `*state.StateDB` pointer and various gas-related fields. The function compares the block fields to the expected values and returns an error if any of the fields do not match.
