### Package

The package is defined as follows:

```go
//go:build (arm64 || amd64) && !openbsd
package pebble
```

This package is only built for arm64 or amd64 architectures and not for openbsd.

### Imports

The following packages are imported:

```go
import (
	"testing"

	"github.com/cockroachdb/pebble"
	"github.com/cockroachdb/pebble/vfs"
	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/ethdb"
	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/ethdb/dbtest"
)
```

- `testing`: This package provides support for automated testing of Go packages.
- `pebble`: This package provides a key-value store implementation.
- `vfs`: This package provides an abstraction for file systems.
- `ethdb`: This package provides an interface for key-value stores used in Ethereum.
- `dbtest`: This package provides a suite of tests for key-value stores.

### Functions

#### TestPebbleDB

```go
func TestPebbleDB(t *testing.T)
```

This function is a test function that tests the PebbleDB implementation. It runs the `TestDatabaseSuite` function from the `dbtest` package. The `TestDatabaseSuite` function takes a function that returns an implementation of the `ethdb.KeyValueStore` interface. In this case, the function returns a `Database` struct that contains a `pebble.DB` instance.

#### BenchmarkPebbleDB

```go
func BenchmarkPebbleDB(b *testing.B)
```

This function is a benchmark function that benchmarks the PebbleDB implementation. It runs the `BenchDatabaseSuite` function from the `dbtest` package. The `BenchDatabaseSuite` function takes a function that returns an implementation of the `ethdb.KeyValueStore` interface. In this case, the function returns a `Database` struct that contains a `pebble.DB` instance.

### Structs

#### Database

```go
type Database struct {
	db *pebble.DB
}
```

This struct represents a PebbleDB database. It contains a `pebble.DB` instance. The `pebble.DB` instance is used to interact with the key-value store.
