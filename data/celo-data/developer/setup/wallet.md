# Testnet Wallets

How to create and fund a testnet wallets to use for developing Celo dApps.

---

## Getting Started

While developing and deploying dApps on Celo, itâ€™s helpful to have a wallet prepared with funds to pay for any transactions you make on the blockchain. These can be set up using either real or test funds, and this allows application developers and users to interact Celo applications more easily.

:::tip

This guide will focus on funding an account on MetaMask with Celo ([Alfajores testnet](/network) tokens). You can also use the [Celo Extension Wallet](/wallet/) if you prefer. Additionally, you can fund your wallet with real Celo if you would like to deploy to the Celo mainnet.

:::

## Download a Wallet

When deploying a dApp, you will need to pay for transactions that write data to the Celo blockchain. This is done using a wallet funded with Celo on your preferred network.

- Download [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for your browser
- If using MetaMask, [Connect MetaMask to Celo](/wallet/metamask/use) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLHeCb01fzs)) to access Celo network options from your wallet

## Create your Account

You are now able to fund an account that you can access using your browser extension wallet. You can do this using accounts you create with the wallet, ganache or from the [Celo CLI](/cli/).

### Using a wallet

MetaMask allows you to easily create and manage accounts. This provides you with a quick way to create and fund an account to use when interacting with your dApp.

- From your MetaMask extension, select **Celo (Alfajores Tesnet)**

<!-- ![select alfajores network in MM](/img/doc-images/testnet-wallet/image1.png) -->

- Choose wallet **Settings**, select **Create Account**, name your account, and select **Create**

<!-- ![select create account MM](/img/doc-images/testnet-wallet/image2.png) -->

- View your account details and copy your account address from the top center of the user interface

### Using Ganache

Deploying locally requires that you have a local blockchain setup. Install and start a local blockchain using the Celo ganache-cli.

#### Install Ganache

```
npm install -g @celo/ganache-cli
```

#### Start Ganache

```
ganache-cli --port 7545
```

Ganache will return a list of available accounts, private keys, and additional wallet details that you can access on port 7545.

Note that `@celo/ganache-cli` does not currently allow you to send transactions and pay fees in stable currencies, nor does it include the core protocol contracts. To run a development chain with the protocol contracts consider using the [celo-devchain package](/developer/setup/development-chain#1-use-the-celo-devchain-npm-package).

```

Creating an account will return its account details as shown below (details will be specific to your account).
