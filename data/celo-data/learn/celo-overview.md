# Welcome to Celo

Celo's mission, vision, and goals for financial prosperity for everyone.

---

## Crypto made for Mobile

[Celo](https://celo.org/) is a mobile-first blockchain that makes decentralized financial (DeFi) tools and services accessible to anyone with a mobile phone. It aims to break down barriers by bringing the powerful benefits of DeFi to the users of the 6 billion smartphones in circulation today.

## Celo's Mission

The company’s mission is to build a financial system that creates the conditions of prosperity for everyone. Celo enables native and non-native digital assets–both cryptographic and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)–to circulate freely across devices, carriers, and countries. This makes money mobile, global and accessible like never before. Celo is supported by a community of organizations and individuals, including Jack Dorsey, a16z, and Deutsche Telekom.

## Celo Ecosystem

An Ethereum-compatible technology capable of reaching global users at scale, Celo turns crypto into usable money with a multi-asset system: a governance and staking asset (CELO) and a family of Mento stablecoins. Since the launch of Mainnet in 2020, Celo’s network now supports 1000+ projects from builders, developers, and artists, who everyday create new applications and issue digital currencies from over 100 countries around the world.

CELO is a platform-native reserve and governance asset, serving as the primary asset in the[ stability mechanism](https://celo.org/papers/Celo_Stability_Analysis.pdf) (Mento) that supports stable digital currencies like cUSD and cEUR. CELO’s primary function is stabilization, ensuring the healthy velocity of assets that globally circulate and transact on Celo. CELO also serves as the key governance mechanism for the Celo Platform. Owning and using CELO supports the growth and development of the Celo Platform by enabling each CELO owner to vote on proposals that direct how the core technology operates today and in the future.
