# ðŸŒ± Structure for Celo Sage Tutorials

## Introduction

The Introduction heading **must** be H1: # Introduction

This section is for you to explain the context for this tutorial and why it matters, what we're going to build and learn in this tutorial.

- Explain this section like you're explaining it to 5-year-old (**[ELI5](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/eli5/)**)
- Explain everything in 5-6 lines maximum.

_For example:_

A lot of blockchain projects promise to build a new financial system,but few have thought about mainstream adoption as hard as Celo. With a mobile-first approach where a phone number is all you need to participate in the network, Celo makes cryptocurrency user-friendly and simplifies access to global financial services. Plus, itâ€™s compatible with Ethereum!

## Prerequisites

The Prerequisites heading **must** be H1: # Prerequisites

This section is for you to explain any prior knowledge needed or any existing tutorials that need to be completed first, any tokens that are needed, mention them here.

_For example:_

- In this tutorial, we're going to build a Voting dApp on Celo so before we proceed further make sure to complete the first tutorial "Connect to Celo using hardhat".
- Complete the Example Tutorial, first.

## Requirements

The Requirements heading **must** be H1: # Requirements

**OPTIONAL :** Embed any video content in this section, if your tutorial has any.

Any technology that needs to be installed **prior** to starting the tutorial and that the tutorial will not cover (`Metamask`, `node`, `truffle`, etc). Do not list packages that will be installed during the tutorial.

_For example:_

- We'll need Metamask in this tutorial, install it from [HERE](https://metamask.io/).
- Make sure to have NodeJS 12.0.1+ version installed.

## Body of the Tutorial

- Please do not use "Body of the Tutorial" as a heading, use your own heading that is relevant to the material. "Getting started" is acceptable if you can't think of anything else ðŸ˜‰
- Add any text content necessary to guide readers through your tutorial, and **_remember to proofread your content_** for spelling and grammar before you submit your tutorial. [Grammarly](http://grammarly.com) is a good free program that can help you to avoid spelling and grammar problems.

Points to remember:

- Keep all sub-headings at H2**,** don't go into H3 or lower**:**
- Add only necessary comments in code blocks. **_Do not_** add # style comments to terminal input code blocks.
- Add all relevant code blocks:
- Markdown syntax for code blocks is three backticks at the beginning and the end of the code block. Also make sure that all code blocks have a newline before and after the backticks. _For example_:

````text
  ```js
  const testVariable = 'some string';
  someFunctionCall();
  ///```
````

- ALL code blocks **_must_** have a syntax highlighting type, use ```text if you are not sure.

- ` ```bash ` should _only_ be used for code blocks where you need to have # style comments. This must be done carefully because in many situations the # character will render as a markdown heading.

- Do not use `pre-formatted text` for emphasis - only use **bold** or _italic_ text for emphasis.
- Add Images or code blocks to reflect expected terminal output.

- Take an error-driven approach when writing your tutorial: Add common errors and steps to troubleshoot the errors, _for example:_

> **Not able to connect to the Celo Node, getting an error on executing `node connect.js`**

Let's check for some common causes:
First, make sure you have the `.env` file saved and it's in the correct format as given in the tutorial.

If you're getting an error message like `UnauthorizedError: {"message": "Invalid authentication credentials"}` then make sure to replace the `<API_KEY>` with your correct API key which you copied from the DataHub Dashboard.

Make sure to have the `.env` file saved in your project root folder.

Make sure `NODE_URL` in the `.env` file is correct.
